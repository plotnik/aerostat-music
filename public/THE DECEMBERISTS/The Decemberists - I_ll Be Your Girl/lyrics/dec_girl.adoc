== Once In My Life

[verse]
____
Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?

Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life

Oh, for once in my
Oh, for once in my life
Could just something go
Could just something go right?

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life
My life
All my life

I've been waiting all my life
I've been waiting all my life
All my life (oh, for once in my, oh, for once in my life)

All my life

I could wait for hours
I could wait and never fall down
Never fall down
Never fall down

Lay us down
Beside the river
Face down
Beside the river

== Cutting Stone

[verse]
____
Dreamed I had a cutting stone
Dreamed I held it all my own
It cut through wire, wood, and bone
I'll cut you down, my cutting stone

Cutting stone oh fear me none
Whether wild or whether won
Though I travel far from home
I'll always have my cutting stone

Wandering, I chanced upon
A wayward child lost anon
And when he laid across my chest
My cutting stone it did the rest

Cutting stone oh fear me none
Whether wild or whether won
Though I travel far from home
I'll always have my cutting stone

In a valley green and wide
A suitor wept for a dying bride
And when he turned his eyes on me
A cutting stone did set him free

Cutting stone oh fear me none
Whether wild or whether won
Though I travel far from home
I'll always have my cutting stone

Cutting stone oh fear me none
Whether wild or whether won
Though I travel far from home
I'll always have my cutting stone

There upon a mountaintop
I looked down on to what I'd wrought
And when I saw my labors through
I cut my cutting stone in two

Cutting stone oh fear me none
Whether wild or whether won
Though I travel far from home
I'll always have my cutting stone
I'll always have my cutting stone
I'll cut you down, my cutting stone
____

== Severed

[verse]
____
I lie like a whisper
I lie with the lights out
And it won't take me long just to find you
And it won't take me long just to find you

I'm allied to the winter
So don't you get clever
Don't you get clever
I'm allied to the landslide
Gonna leave you all severed
Gonna leave you all severed

I alone am the answer
I alone will make wrongs right
But in order to root out the cancer
It's got to be kept from the sunlight

I'm allied to the winter
So don't you get clever
Don't you get clever
I'm allied to the landslide
Gonna leave you all severed
Gonna leave you all severed

I was born to a jackal
I was born in a whiteout
Gonna smother you all till I choke you
Gonna smother you all till you kick out

I'm allied to the winter
So don't you get clever
Don't you get clever
I'm allied to the landslide
Gonna leave you all severed
Gonna leave you all severed
____

== Starwatcher

[verse]
____
Starwatcher, starwatcher in the night
Starwatcher, starwatcher bend the light

There's a rider on the road
There's calamity awaiting to unfold
There is poison in the well
There's the arbor of a distant ringing bell
It's says: hold, hold, hold your ground

Skywatcher, skywatcher rules the day
Skywatcher, skywatcher cruel and fey

There are figures on the shore
At the laundromat, they're whispering of war
There a lady on the stairs
All a-shambling with thistles in her hair
Singing: hold, hold, hold your ground
Hold, hold, hold your ground

Starwatcher, starwatcher in the night
____

== Tripping Along

[verse]
____
We were tripping tripping tripping tripping tripping along
While you're orbiting, might I?
While you're orbiting, might I?
Lick you sticky sticky sticky sticky sticky and sweep
They're all turning a blind eye
They're all turning a blind eye

But oh what I'd do just to lie with you die in your arms
What wouldn't I give just to live with that sense of alarm?
But your relatives gathered all clamber about for your mind
And they're tearing and swearing to leave you all naked and blind

So we keep a-ripping ripping ripping ripping rips in the sheets
'Till it's all coming undone
'Till it's all coming undone
And we're drippy drippy drippy drippy, what messes are we?
And I'm due for a line out
And I'm due for a light out

But just as I'm cusping on slumber and dumbing my eyes
What spin-twisting vision comes listing and jelly alike?
And bothering toddles all over this beautiful light
This fickle young sister's away in the dimming of night

La de da de da de da da da
Da de da de da de da da da
Da de da de da de da da da
Da de da de da de da da da
Da de da de da de da da da
Da de da de da de da da da
Da de da de da de da da da da
____

== Your Ghost

[verse]
____
Along the old sea wall
Inside the banquet hall
Below the cellar's stair, maybe you'll find me there
Your ghost, oh your ghost
Your ghost

And when you take your rest
My weight upon your breast
And should you close your eyes
I'll still materialize
Your ghost, oh your ghost
Your ghost

Na na na na na
Na na na na na

And at your final end
When you are free again
No longer long to be
You will be belong to me
Your ghost, oh your ghost
Oh your ghost, oh your ghost

Na na na na na
Na na na na na

Na na na na na
Na na na na na

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Your ghost, oh your ghost
Ghost
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

== Everything Is Awful

[verse]
____
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Everything is awful, everything is...

What's that crashing sound
That follows us around?
That's the sound of all things good breaking

We'll put your fears to rest
You know it's for the best
As a choir of angels sing:

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Everything is awful, everything is...

I know you've worked so hard
To hoist your own petard
Must be so nice; the point stuck in your side

Hang your heavy head
It's safer here in bed
As a choir of angels sing:

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful

Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, thing
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything is awful
Everything is awful, everything is bad

(La la la la
La la la la)
Everything is...

(La la la la
La la la la)
Everything is...

(La la la la
La la la la)
Everything is...

(La la la la
La la la la)
Everything is...

Wake me from my sleep
Could you kindly keep it down?
Could you kindly keep it down, down?
You'll wake me from my sleep
Could you kindly keep it down?
Could you kindly keep it down, down?
____

== Sucker's Prayer

[verse]
____
I was not ready for the roar
I was discontent to wear that heavy load
And so I got down on my knees
Beneath the sucker's prayer
I would go there before

And when nobody did respond
I out my glasses on and went to find a pond
Sending rocks into the pockets of my pants

I wanna love somebody but I don't know how
And I've been so long lonely and it's getting me down
I wanna throw my body in the river and drown
I wanna love somebody but I don't know how

So if you're lost along the way
And if you think that it'll always be this way
Won't you listen to my plea
You'll pick a sucker's prayer
Just go an be there anyway

I wanna love somebody but I don't know how
And I've been so long lonely and it's getting me down
I wanna throw my body in the river and drown
I wanna love somebody but I don't know how

I wanna love somebody but I don't know how

== We All Die Young

[verse]
____
It was late one night, I was counting out my stitches
Waiting by the side of the road
I was a long time gone, slipping off my britches
Feeling like it's time to go home
Yeah, feeling like it's time to go home

And in this dream, Bill Tecumseh Sherman
Glowered at the foot of my bed
He was long and lean, he spoke in perfect German
And I recorded all that he said
Yeah, I recorded all that he said

He said:
"We all die young
We all die young
We all die young
We all die young"

When I woke next day, layered in the lashings
Feeling for the hole in my head
I was thinking 'bout my dad, thinking 'bout the nashings
Of all the bitter things that he said
Yeah, all the worrying things that he had said

And he said:
"We all die young
We all die young
We all die young
We all die young"

Son, he said:
"We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young"
We all die young!

And it came to pass when everything had ended
The world was just a grubby balloon
And I spoke up, said "sorry if I've offended"
This voice came from the back of the room
Oh, screaming from the back of the room

It said:
"We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die, we all die young!
We all die young"

One more time!
"We all die young
Bill Tecumseh Sherman
We all die young!
We all die young
Sorry if I've offended
We all die young!
We all die young
We all die, we all die young!
We all die young"

We all die young!
We all die young!
We all die, we all die young!

We all die young!
We all die young!
We all die, we all die young!

== Rusalka, Rusalka / The Wild Rushes

[verse]
____
Rusalka, Rusalka your arms out of water
Your hair like an alien bloom
Dark-eyed Rusalka, your brow tressed in flowers
Pale in a liminal moon
And all that you are is a star on the water

When first I went swimming, I heeded no warning
And dared breach your rippling pool
As a lulled and lingered, the ring slipped my finger
And drifted down the [?]
And all that I want is to fall in your shallows

And now we are wed, the water our bed
And bank to bank property lake
And you are my wild-eyed rusalka, my river bride
Drag me down, take me away
And here we will lie, you and I, 'neath the cold, dark sky

Beware the wild rushes, my mother told me
That grow on the bank side along the salt sea
But I being young, I heeded her none
So to the wild rushes the wind carried me

The summer was here and the sun it was high
And to the wild rushes I came by and by
And there took my seat and dipped in my feet
And through the wild rushes, a voice sweetly cried:

Come down, my little darling, come closer to me
The water is warm; it is salty and free
I long for your touch but I won't ask too much
And I, being foolish, walked in to my knees

Come down, little darling, and lay at my breast
Oh come a little closer and I'll do the rest
I waited so long for a lover to come
And I, being foolish, walked in to my chest

Come down, my little darling, oh farther come in
For deeper the water, the sweeter the sin
My lily lies here, if you'd only draw near
And I, being foolish, went in to my chin

Oh come, my little darling, do you feel my cool breath
Do you feel my arms around you so warm and so wet?
Swept from my feet, she pulled me beneath
And in the wild rushes, I went to my death
____

== I'll Be Your Girl

[verse]
____
When the summer days live to bore you
And the river lies long before you
And the one that you love ignores you
I'll be your girl

Like a senator works a full room
Like a lover undone by full moon
Like a lily alive in full bloom
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage
And all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man
But I'd be that much more
And more

So when everything soft upbraids you
When fortune has long betrayed you
And you're longing for an arm to stay you
I'll be your girl

And when the tempests rage
And all the oceans roar
At your door
I could be your man
But I'd be that much more
And more

So if you're ever feeling less your time due
Like someone bereft and lied to
And you never need a guy to guide you
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl
I'll be your girl
