== Where I'm At

[verse]
____  
____

== Parallels

[verse]
____
Woke up lost
In a world I didn't know
I shook it off and
I'm trying to make a go

Ever get the feeling that the story isn't done?
And you know that you are not the only one?

And I know you're out there somewhere
And I know that you are well
Looking for an answer
But only time can tell
Parallels

All things being equal
I'd rather not forget
The things I've seen
And the people that I've met

But something down inside me makes me think there's something more
And I don't have any proof, but I'm sure

And I know you're out there somewhere
And I know that you are well
Looking for an answer
But only time can tell
Parallels

Woke up lost
In a world I can't escape
What I'll become
Is slowly taking shape

Start again is not the end but altogether new
And I'm never giving up 'till I find you

And I know you're out there somewhere
And I know that you are well
Looking for an answer
But only time can tell
Parallels

== Lockdown Hurricane

[verse]
____
That wind a-blowin'
It's getting strong
The rain a'fallin'
Been falling too long

The pressure in the clouds has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane

They tried to warn us
I didn't care
Said don't be stupid
Get out of there

And now I know it's much too late
Who will discover the remains?
Honey we're in a lockdown hurricane

Don't you see it?
We're goddamn fools
We always had to break the rules

That wind a-blowin'
It's getting strong
The rain a'fallin'
Been falling too long

The pressure in the house has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane 
____

== Agatha Chang

[verse]
____
Agatha was beautiful
Her long black hair and aching eyes
Even when she didn't feel so good she looked alright
She always had a smile
And it was good for a while

I wouldn't answer each time the phone rang
But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang

Agatha, she wasn't mean
She didn't cheat, she never lied
Even if she disagreed with you it wasn't a fight
Made you feel like you're both right
But then I lost sight

I couldn't bear to break up my old gang
But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang

What was so important then?
I haven't a clue
How could I have been so blind and cruel?

Agatha, where did you go?
Do I have the slightest chance
I could make up for everything that I did wrong?
But I know it's just a song
And you're probably long gone

Forgot all about her
Each night that I sang
But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang 
____

== A Swallow in the Sun

[verse]
____
My love, let me bring
Anything your heart desires
Everything you'll ever need
When you rise
When you retire

Sweet thing, oh my word
Such a very pretty sight
As a swallow in the sun
As a sparrow in the night

My love, can you not feel it
I don't know how to let you go on
A swallow in the sun
A sparrow in the night
All alone

Dear heart, if I may
You are beauty of the earth
You are broken like a glass
You don't know what you are worth

My love, can you not feel it
I don't know how to let you go on
A swallow in the sun
A sparrow in the night
All alone 
____

== Where I'm From

[verse]
____
Three Ghosts and I, sittin' on the couch last night
Catchin' up on all the time
It's been a while, since we got together and
You know that it's often on my mind

So long ago, I left it in the dust, well I was so young and dumb
Ran far away, but I have to admit, sometimes I miss where I'm from

Let's have a drink, to everything that we went through
It wasn't always so bad
We can't forget, each other's company
And all of the goodtimes we had

So long ago, I left it in the dust, well I was so young and dumb
Ran far away, but I have to admit, sometimes I miss where I'm from

Three ghosts and I, sittin' on the couch last night
Catchin' up on all the time
It's been a while, since we got together and
You know that it's often on my mind

So long ago, I left it in the dust, well I was so young and dumb
Ran far away, but I have to admit, sometimes I miss where I'm from 
____

== Series of Misunderstandings

[verse]
____
Like a dying man who you tell
You will be alright that is the sell
When you know full well it isn't true
That's what's happened between me and you

I know how you don't want to see
That bored look on my face but you see
I don't think you know how to change it
Inching towards the end bit by bit

It's worth noting that it could be saved
If not for the recent events
A series of misunderstandings
Set the course for a crash landing

If I could do just one thing
Set the clock back many years ago
I'd teach that motherfucker that raised you
How to treat you right 
____

== Kindred Spirit

[verse]
____
She has an easy going way
It doesn't matter what you'd say
I understand just what she means
When she says she doesn't care
She doesn't let it wreck her day

She's a kindred spirit
She doesn't have an act
She's got a real big heart
And I gotta win it back

Hard to say how much it meant
The best days I've ever spent
She understands just what I mean
When I say that I don't care
She knows my true intent

She's a kindred spirit
With no plan of attack
She's got a real big heart
And I gotta win it back

Every day I live in regret and pain
You just don't let that get away

There's a kindness that she hears
She knows we're all so full of fear

She's a kindred spirit
When all fades to black
She's got a real big heart
And I gotta win it back 
____

== Gentlemen's Choice

[verse]
____
Slept in all day
In dirty sheets
The stain on my shirt
Been there for weeks

When I was young I had a dream
I would be held in high esteem
I thought I'd end up a gentleman
Distinguished, respected, refined

The life that I've led
It's better unsaid
The world has no use for my kind

Too many years
Getting my way
Never let anyone
Have their say

How could I think it would work out?
Never a question, never a doubt

I thought I'd end up a gentleman
Accomplished, revered and admired

The life that I've led
I'm better off dead
The world has no room for my kind
____

== Dead Reckoning

[verse]
____
Flying through the dark
Dead reckoning
My gages can't be trusted
Can't see a goddamn thing

I know the day is coming
That catches up with me
I told you you're no match
But then who could be

Thought we were the lonely type
On an island of the lost
But it was only me
Because you got lost

I can't change you
I can't change anyone 
____

== Answers

[verse]
____
Living lost has been the way
Since the day I came along
Drifting through the dead-eyed days
When every turn is wrong

And I knew it was the darkest road
That I'd never know just how
To travel on to get somewhere
But I thought I'd have some answers by now

Meaning to find meaning
In the most meaningless of times
Believing I believed in something
Beyond equals in time

And I opened up my heart and said
This much I'll allow
All who enter welcome in
And I thought I'd have some answers by now

Living lost is not the way
To go from here on out
Attesting in the dead-eye age
Is not all it's about

And I may not have that far to go
I might make it somehow
The brightest light may shine ahead
But I thought I'd have some answers by now 
____

== Mistakes of My Youth

[verse]
____
In the waning days ahead,
I gotta look back down the road.
I know that it's not too late.
All the stupid things I've said,
and people I've hurt in my time.
I hope it's not my fate

To keep defeating my own self,
and keep repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating,
the mistakes of my youth.

In the dark of night, I might
be able to make myself think
that I'm still a younger man.
But when the light of day shines down,
there's no way to get around it,
I'm not the younger man.

I keep defeating my own self,
and keep repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating,
the mistakes of my youth.

The choice is mine for making
a better road ahead
the road that I've been taking,
headed for a dead-end,
but it's not too late to turn around

In the final moments
I hope that I know that I tried
to do best I could

To stop defeating my own self
and stop repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating,
the mistakes of my youth. 
____

== Where I'm Going

[verse]
____
Can't say I know what will happen tomorrow
I can't say I know if it's joy or sorrow
I can't say how long I'll stand at the line that I'm towing
But I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going

All you see, a world so full of need
And all I need is a pocket full of seeds
Sunflowers shooting up to a sky that is glowing
And I've got a good feeling 'bout where I'm going

Prayed for rain, it might not come
Can't save the day, save someone
I can't say if the flowers will keep on growing
But I've got a good feeling about where I'm going 
____

== Lonely Lockdown Hurricane

[verse]
____
That wind a-blowin'
It's getting strong
The rain a'fallin'
Been falling too long

The pressure in the clouds has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane

They tried to warn us
I didn't care
Said don't be stupid
Get out of there

And now I know it's much too late
Who will discover the remains?
Honey we're in a lockdown hurricane

Don't you see it?
We're goddamn fools
We always had to break the rules

That wind a-blowin'
It's getting strong
The rain a'fallin'
Been falling too long

The pressure in the house has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane 
____

== Bow Out

[verse]
____
A lot of what she said
And much of what she did
I don't doubt that she meant well
While drifting and wounded

But it's a game she plays
A game I'd never win
Those days aren't coming back
To change the state I'm in

In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about
Making up reality, and jealousy, and doubt
I bow out

Everything I am
Or what I used to be
Is not part of the hollow shell
Of a man that you see

All the time unsure
All my days a waste
Never knowing where I stood
Much less which way I face

In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about
Making up reality, and jealousy, and doubt
I bow out
____

== A Good Deal

[verse]
____
My plan to play it cool
Has not been going well
I have such a hard time
Keeping the anger hidden

I've run it through my head
A dozen times or more
And each time it ends with me
Not acting as I did

A grievous oversight that I cannot erase
You couldn't know where to take it to
And none of it matters now
However I appeal
All of it's gone
I've missed a good deal

You disappointed me
In ways I cannot count
But you were the best thing
To happen to me

And that is no reason to
Forget all that you've done
I couldn't expect you to
Give credence to my plea

A grievous oversight that I cannot erase
You couldn't know where to take it to
And none of it matters now
However I may feel
All of it's gone
I've missed a good deal

An effortless beauty I had not come across
It's a heavy loss
And now it's my cross to bear forever more
I can be sure

And nothing else matters now
Whatever I reveal
All of it's gone
I've missed a good deal 
____

== Good Morning Bright Eyes

[verse]
____
Good morning bright eyes
How did you sleep last night?
Well, I didn't sleep so well

The days are going faster
No time for this disaster
Well, I can't do it anymore
And I'm sure

With a heavy heart I tell you this
And if I don't I'll be remissed
There's nothing worse than living lies

I need you be the leader
We don't [?] the leader
This flame has stayed for all these years
And I've kneeled

We gave it a shot, now I wouldn't to say
Why don't we just back up and call it a day
There's something out there for us both

The days are going faster
No time for this disaster
Well, I can't do it anymore
And I'm sure

Good morning bright eyes
How did you sleep last night?
Well, I didn't sleep so well
____

== Millicent Don't Blame Yourself

[verse]
____
Millicent, don't blame yourself
Sweetheart, there's no one else
More important to me than you
There's nothing that you need to do
To prove to me that you care
I know you do

Millicent, just let 'em talk
'Cause this thing, it's a lock
And no one's gonna make that untrue
There's nothing anyone can do
To change the way I feel about you
And you know that's true

Millicent, just lean on me
I know that I can be
Everything you need me to be
There's no wall that I can't crash through
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
For you

Millicent, don't blame yourself
Sweetheart, there's no one else in the world 
____

== Thanks I Guess

[verse]
____
In the evening when the sun goes black
I sit alone and I plan my stunning comeback

I got your worst and you got my best
I past the test
I got alive from your endless mess
thanks I guess

I sleep well knowing everything I earned
My companion the lessons I have learned

I got your worst and you got my best
I past the test
I got alive from your endless mess
Thanks I guess

the yellow sky the blue around the clouds
does still be standing makes a man feel proud
aaahhhh...
