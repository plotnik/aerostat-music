== From Which I Came / A Magic World

[verse]
____
Ten pounds and a head of hair
Came into without a care
What they thought were cries
Were little laughs
Only looking forward and moving fast
The little bundle had arrived
And i was happy to be alive
In a magic world

Long days and dreaming nights
Wide eyes take in all the sights
A little wonder goes a long, long way
Learning where to go and what to say
Say hello to your new son
Well he sure is having fun
In a magic world

Every moment's built to last
When you're living without a past
In a magic world 
____

== Son Of A Bitch

[verse]
____
Mother couldn't love me
But that didn't stop me
From liking her
She was my mom
And i was no son of a bitch

Daddy was a drunk
A most unpleasant man
Asleep on the floor
Just imside the front door
With a smile underneath his red nose

The wrong look his way
Well that could really wreck his day
And believe me when i say
It would wreck your day too

Grandma took me in
Though times were pretty thin
Said i was no son of a bitch

Down on my knees
Begging god please 
____

== Blinking Lights (For Me)

[verse]
____
Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees
Blinking down a morse code signal
Especially for me

Ain't no rainbow in the sky
In the middle of the night
But the signal's coming through
One day i will be alright again

Blinking lights on the highway cars
Stopping one by one
Get a look at the accident
Didn't see that one coming

And the doctor in the sky
Gonna bring his chopper down
Gonna bring me out alive
And set me on the ground
Once more again

Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees
____

== Trouble With Dreams

[verse]
____
There's nothing that i wanna do
More than get alone and be with you
Trouble with dreams is they don't come true
And when they do they can't catch up to you

You don't need a thing from me
But i need something big from you
'cause you know i've got
An awful lot of big dreams

I'm walking down a lonely road
Clear to me now but i was never told
Trouble with dreams is you never know
When to hold on and when to let go

If you let me down it's alright
At least that leaves something for me
'cause you know i've got
An awful lot of big dreams

This is the life that i must lead now
Crossing fingers and wiping brow
Trouble with dreams is you can't pretend
Something with no beginning has an end

You don't need a thing from me
But i need something big from you
'cause you know i've got an awful lot of big dreams 
____

== Suicide Life

[verse]
____
You think you'll get under ol' monsieur's lid
And try to imagine all the things that he did
You don't know where i'm gonna go
You don't know where i'll go

I'll go none too bravely
Into the night
I'm so tired of living
The suicide life
That ain't no reason to live

Wake up in the night and think of all the years
Falling from the ceiling and covering your ears
You don't know how you're gonna get out
You don't know how you'll get out

I'll go none too bravely
Into the night
I'm so tired of living
The suicide life
That ain't no reason to live

Call up your best friend
And tell him a lie
You've got to be kidding
I'm not really high
I dont know where i'm gonna go
I don't know where i'll go

I'll go none too bravely
Into the night
I'm so tired of living
The suicide life
That ain't no reason to live
____

== In The Yard, Behind The Church

[verse]
____
In the yard, behind the church where
Butterflies and blackbirds search for
A safe place to rest the night away
We will go down to the brook and
Sit upon the overlook then
Forget about the troubles of the day

We will walk among the graves of
Men long dead with presidents' names and
Listen to the water flow softly by
I will kiss you on the lips now
And as the sky grows dark we'll strip down
And let the water wash away all lies

In the yard, behind the church where
Butterflies and blackbirds perch on
Gray stones as the garden's growing dim
We will lay down on the ground and
Put our cheeks against the dirt down
Where it no longer matters
Where you've been 
____

== Railroad Man

[verse]
____
Feel like an old railroad man
Ridin' out on the bluemont line
Hummin' along old dominion blues
Not much to see and not much left to lose
And i know i can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but i'll know
How to find my way back

I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And i guess i may never understand
The times that i live in
Are not made for a railroad man

I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now
And this train is just too slow
And i know i can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but i'll know
How to find my way back
____

== The Other Shoe

[verse]
____
It's a beautiful morning
The sky is black as ink
The city's sleeping still
And soon they'll wake up
To the stink

And soon they'll wake up
To the stink of life passing them by
Wake up and smell the stink of their lives

The garbage trucks are coming
To take your shit to the dump
You're smelling pretty now
Such a pretty little lump
A pretty little lump of flesh
Who's lost your way
Another night another day

And when you sleep at night
Dreaming of the pretty things
Don't be too surprised
When the telephone rings

I'll be sitting here
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
I'll be sitting here
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
____

== Last Time We Spoke

[verse]
____
When you called
Your voice was so grave
I knew it would be
The last time we spoke

You said something
That i could not hear
To hear with my own ears
The last time we spoke

And it's a hard time
Trying to get through
All the days that drag on
Thinking about you

Nothing hurts
Like someone who knows
Everything about you
Leaving you behind

And it's a hard time
Trying to get through
All the days that drag on
Thinking about you

When you called
You might as well have killed me
And that was the last time
The last time we spoke 
____

== Mother Mary

[verse]
____
People talking sound like dogs
Barking through the trees
Making no sense at all
Meaning nothing to me

Mother mary
Quite contrary
I did not mean to let you go
So quick

People talking crack me up
They don't have a little clue
What it's like to be me
What it's like to lose you

Mother mary
I grow weary
I did not mean to let you go
So quick

People talking sound like dogs
Barking up the wrong tree
Take a good man down
And set the evil free

Mother mary
Quite contrary
I did not mean to let you go
So quick 
____

== Going Fetal

[verse]
____
Everyone is going fetal
It's the dance the kids all feel
Just get down under your desk
Feels like your mama's nest
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
It's the one thats really real
You're gonna love it if you give it a try
You just lay down like you're gonna die
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
If you feel like your fate is sealed
Then just get down and curl on up
Just like a little helpless pup
Alright

Everyone is going fetal 
____

== Understanding Salesmen

[verse]
____
A knock on the door means
Hello jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to niagara falls

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But i would rather take you
For a test drive

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That i must prove to you

While i look out
On the passing fields
The sun through the bugs
On the windshield
Makes me feel
Like i
Don't matter

A knock on the door means
Hello jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to niagara falls
____

== Checkout Blues

[verse]
____
I've got something
Maybe i should tell you
I may check out
At any given time

Things won't get better
Until they get much worse
Is the curse stronger than me
Or am i stronger than the curse

Everyone is scared of me
And i'm scared of me too
Never know just what i'm gonna do

Heads up, kittens
Everything is bad
The sky is dark now
But it's the best dark i ever had

Hang on to a little thing
And let it guide the way
Bring it with you to
Another day

I've got something
Maybe i should tell you
I'm hanging on here
And i'm really gonna try

Things won't get better
Until they get much worse
Am i stronger than the curse

Blinking down a morse code signal
Especially for me
Ain't no rainbow in the sky
In the middle of the night
But the signal's coming through
One day i will be alright again

Blinking lights on the highway cars
Stopping one by one
Get a look at the accident
Didn't see that one coming

And the doctor in the sky
Gonna bring his chopper down
Gonna bring me out alive
And set me on the ground
Once more again

Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees 
____

== Dust Of Ages

[verse]
____
This is the day
That i give myself up cold

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And so you shake your coat off
And get on your way

Bloodshot and trembling
A new day has begun

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And you blow it all away
And get on your way

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
But i'm not fuckin' around anymore
I'm on my way
____

== Old Shit / New Shit

[verse]
____
Everyone loves you
Nobody cares
An awful collection
Of enemies and friends
Congratulations to you
With sad regrets
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin

The psychic pain
Of living in this world
Is overwhelming me
Again and again
A beautiful afternoon
Inside you in your bed
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin

Nobody loves you
Everyone cares
None of them know what's
Coming 'round the bend
Congratulations to me
Many happy returns
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin

And cry your guts out 'til you got no more

Made you feel like it's not such a bad world
Hey man now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what
This life is all about

Well i just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill
But hey man now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to care too much
'bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh cut grass
And thought about the moment and when it will pass
Hey man now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really living what
This life is all about

Now what would you say if i told you that
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat
Hey man now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more
Hey man now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world
Hey man now you're really living

People sing
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
And cry your guts out 'til you got no more
Hey man now you're really living

Just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill
But hey man now i'm really living

== I'm Going To Stop Pretending That I Didn't Break Your Heart

[verse]
____
I'm gonna tell you what you need to hear
And i'm a little too late
By three or four years
And it may not make much sense
Now that we are apart
But i'm going to stop pretending
That i didn't break your heart

You see i never thought enough of myself
To realize that losing me could mean
Something like the tears in your eyes
And i want to tell you i'm sorry
And it's too late to start
But i'm going to stop pretending
That i didn't break your heart

And it's christmas eve
Years down the line
Sitting here wishing i'd treated you better
When you were mine
And i have no way of knowing where you are
But i'm going to stop pretending
That i didn't break your heart

I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't know what i was doing
But i know what i have done 
____

== To Lick Your Boots

[verse]
____
Miss o'malley didn't mean what she said
Got a heart but a head full of lead
She can dream but she never can do it
You're alright and you're gonna get through it

People spend their days
Trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they're not fit
To lick your boots

Nothing harder to watch
Than an englishman
Trying to cry
Even if he can
He can dream but he never can do it
Saying you -- you're the one that blew it

People spend their days
Trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they're not fit
To lick your boots 
____

== If You See Natalie

[verse]

If you see natalie
Send along this message
I know that you've been through
An awful lot of late

Girl,
Steady the trembling hand
That's what you do
Girl,
Steady your trembling hands
Then see what's in front of you

Friends and fortunetellers
They all say you're gonna die
If you don't brighten up
You know you gotta try

Girl,
Steady the trembling hand
That's what you do
Girl,
Steady your trembling hands
Then see what's in front of you

If you see natalie
Send along this message
You may not need this world
But this world needs you here

Girl,
Steady the trembling hand
That's what you do
Girl,
Steady your trembling hands
Then see what's in front of you

You might not feel it now
But you're gonna get there
And see it somehow
Youre gonna be alright, girl 
____

== Sweet Li'l Thing

[verse]
____
The feeling of understanding is very rare
For someone like me it's hard to find
Somebody to care
She's got a way about her
Changes everything
She's got a way about her
She's my sweet li'l thing

Making love with her indie rock
Playing on her stereo
Holding hands going down the road
When she drives me home
She's got a magic about her
Makes me wanna sing
She's got a magic about her
She's my sweet li'l thing

Spent the day laying in her bed
My nose against hers
Later we went for a drive
Didn't know where we were
Man i never felt so alive

Nobody gets the girl
But baby i do
Nobody gets me either
But she sees through
She's got a glow around her
Shines on everything
She's got a glow around her
She's my sweet li'l thing 
____

== Whatever Happened To Soy Bomb

[verse]
____
Blue light is flickering
Through the city streets
One billion tv sets
Glowing off concrete
One day closer to death
I know that i don't have too long
Whatever happened to soy bomb

Lunch box collector loves all the pussycats
But when he goes to bed
He wonders where he's at
Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
Living in an old sitcom
Whatever happened to soy bomb

The day is coming when you'll have to think of it
Was it really worth it
All that shit

Blue light is flickering
Through the cloudy sky
One billiob lonely hearts
Beat until they die
One day closer to death
I know i don't have too long
Whatever happened to soy bomb 
____

== Ugly Love

[verse]
____
Dear cousin,
I got your letter
It was more than i thought i deserved
Well she sounds perfect, all i dream of
And i dream about so much it is absurd
But when i get there and she sees me
I'll be impressed if she does not run screaming

My kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time

I had a thought while i was sleeping
And i dreamed about a place for us to rest
Eternity under the old oak tree
But i go too far i guess
Maybe i'll think about tomorrow
And maybe i can get her to stay that long

'cause my kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time

And if she finds me so repulsive
She wouldn't be the first to wretch
Well i decided one day long ago
I was never gonna be the greatest catch
And if she cares about the car i drive
Then she can get in hers
The moment i arrive

'cause my kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time 
____

== Losing Streak

[verse]
____
Was i wrong about the world
It's a beautiful new place
Where else could a creep like me
Meet such a pretty face

Meeting every day with the rising sun
Looking up it's looking like
My losing streak is done

Used to always feel like
Wished that i was dressed better
Never had a lot of luck
Until i finally met her

Feeling like the weight that weighed a ton
Lifted off my shoulders now
My losing streak is done

Always felt like giving in
To the feeling i can't win
But i took it on the chin
Now i'm finally cashing in

Meeting every day with the rising sun
Looking up it's looking like
My losing streak is done

My losing streak is done
I said my losing streak is done
Did you hear me
I said my losing streak is done 
____

== The Stars Shine In The Sky Tonight

[verse]
____
I can't live in a world that you have left behind
Seen a lot, been through too much
But this is where i draw the line

It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And i just wanna go with you

December is a lonely month
In a year of lonely days
It's hard to tell which way is up
Or down or out
Or through the haze

People cheat and people lie
While you just watch it all go by
Counting days until you die

The stars shine in the sky tonight
Like a path beyond the grave
When you wish upon that star
There's two of us you need to save

It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And i just wanna go with you 
____

== Things The Grandchildren Should Know

[verse]
____
I go to bed real early
Everybody thinks it's strange
I get up early in the morning
No matter how disappointed i was
With the day before
It feels new

I don't leave the house much
I don't like being around people
Makes me nervous and weird
I don't like going to shows either
It's better for me to stay home
Some might think it means i hate people
But that's not quite right

I do some stupid things
But my heart's in the right place
And this i know

I got a dog
I take him for a walk
And all the people like to say hello
I'm used to staring down at the sidewalk cracks
I'm learning how to say hello
Without too much trouble

I'm turning out just like my father
Though i swore i never would
Now i can say that i have a love for him
I never really understood
What it must have been like for him
Living inside his head

I feel like he's here with me now
Even though he's dead

It's not all good and it's not all bad
Don't believe everything you read
I'm the only one who knows what it's like
So i though i'd better tell you
Before i leave

So in the end i'd like to say
That i'm a very thankful man
I tried to make the most of my situations
And enjoy what i had
I knew true love and i knew passion
And the difference between the two
And i had some regrets
But if i had to do it all again
Well, it's something i'd like to do
