== I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter

[verse]
____
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say
I hope you're feeling better
I'll close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And I'm gonna make believe it came from you

Oh yeah

I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

Oh yeah

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And I'm make believe it came from you
Oh yeah
I'm gonna make believe it came from you

Oh yeah

== Home (When Shadows Fall)

[verse]
____
Evening brings the close of day,
Skies of blue begin to grey,
Crimson hues are fading in the west.
Evening ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be,
Memories of those I love the best.

When shadows fall
And trees whisper, "Day is ending",
My thoughts are ever wending home.
When crickets call,
My heart is forever yearning
Once more to be returning home.

When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one.
Night covers all,
And though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me home.

When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one.
Night covers all,
And though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me home.

== It's Only A Paper Moon

[verse]
____
I never feel a thing is real
When I'm away from you
Out of your embrace
The world's a temporary parking place

Mmm, mm, mm, mm
A bubble for a minute
Mmm, mm, mm, mm
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it

Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me 
____

== More I Cannot Wish You

[verse]
____
Velvet, I can wish you,
For the collar of your coat,
And fortune smiling all along your way,
But more I cannot wish you,
Then to wish you find your love,
Your own true love this day.

Mansions, I can wish you,
Seven footmen all in red,
And calling cards upon a silver tray,
But more I cannot wish you,
Then to wish you find your love,
Your own true love this day.

Standing there,
Gazing at you,
Full of the bloom of youth,
Standing there,
Gazing at you,
With the sheep's eye,
And the licerish tooth.

Music, I can wish you,
Merry music while you're young,
And wisdom, when your hair has turned to gray,
But more I cannot wish you,
Then to wish you find your love,
Your own true love this day.

With the sheep's eye,
And the lickerish tooth,
And the strong arms,
To carry you away

== The Glory Of Love

[verse]
____
You've got to give a little, take a little,
And let your poor heart break a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little,
Until the clouds roll by a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

As long as there's the two of us,
We've got the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us,
We've got each other's arms.
You've got to win a little, lose a little,
Yes, and always have the blues a little.
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.

That's the story of, that's the glory of,
That's the story of, that's the glory of,
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love

== We Three (My Echo, My Shadow And Me)

[verse]
____
We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me
We three we're not a crowd, we're not even company
My echo, my shadow and me

What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow,
I talk with my echo but where is the one I love

We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me

We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow,
I talk with my echo but where is the one I love

We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me 
____

== Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive

[verse]
____
Gather 'round me, everybody
Gather 'round me, while I preach some
Feel a sermon coming on here
The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm agin'
If you wanna hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right

You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark,
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

== My Valentine

[verse]
____
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My Valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine,
My Valentine

And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly

And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine,
My Valentine

What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My Valentine
____

== Always

[verse]
____
Ev'rything went wrong
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue
For the longest while
I forgot to smile
Then I met you
Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I've found you at last

I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand
Always, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always

Dreams will all come true
Growing old with you
And time will fly
Caring each day more
Than the day before
Till spring rolls by
Then when the springtme has gone
Then will my love linger on

== My Very Good Friend The Milkman

[verse]
____
My very good friend, the milkman says
That I've been losing too much sleep
He doesn't like the hours I keep
And he suggests that you should marry me

My very good friend, the mailman says
That it would make his burden less
We both had the same address
And he suggests that you should marry me

And then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views

My very good friends, the neighbors say
They've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me

== Bye Bye Blackbird

[verse]

Pack up all my cares and woes,
Here i go, singing low,
Bye, bye, blackbird.
Where somebody waits for me,
Sugar is sweet, so is she,

Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me.

Make my bed and light the light,
I'll arrive late tonight,
Blackbird, bye, bye.

Oh, blackbird, bye, bye.

At last I've wake up to see what you've done
All I can do is pack up and run

You say, you wished you'd be true
Oh, but deep down in my heart
I know our love could never grow

[verse]

Two and two are four
Four and four are eight

Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me you'd stop and see
How beautiful they are

== Only Our Hearts

[verse]
____
If only my love was here
I’d be taking the time to feel it
Washing over my body and soul
If only my love, only my love was here

I wish that my heart was strong
I’d be letting it beat, much faster
At the thought of you holding me near
I wish that my heart, wish that my heart was strong

Hoping to be where you are
I’m longing to be your lover
Don’t want to ever be far
Apart from you my love

But only our hearts will know
If we’re gonna spend it together
Holding on to the dreams that we share
Only our hearts, know how much love is there

Only our hearts, know how much love is there
Yes only our hearts, know how much love is there
