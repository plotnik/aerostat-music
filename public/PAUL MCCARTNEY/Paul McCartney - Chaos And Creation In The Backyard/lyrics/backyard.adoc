== Fine Line

[verse]
____
There is a fine line, between recklessness and courage
It's about time, you understood which road to take
It's a fine line, your decision makes a difference
Get it wrong, you'll be making a big mistake

Come on brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come on brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay

Whatever's more important to you
You've got to change what you wanna do
Whatever's more important to be
That's the view that you've gotta see

There is a long way, between chaos and creation
If you don't say, which one of these your gonna choose
It's a long way, and in every contradiction
Seems to say it's a game that your bound to loose

Come on brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come on brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay

Come on back
Come on back
Come on back to me

It's a fine line
It's a fine line

Whatever's more important to you
You've got to choose what you wanna do
Whatever's more important to be
Well that's the view that you've gotta see

It's a fine line
It's a fine line
Whatever's more important to you (It's a fine line)
You got to choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be (It's a fine line)
That's the thing that you gotta see

== How Kind Of You

[verse]
____
How kind of you to think of me
When I was out of sorts
It really meant alot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind, as you

The thoughtfulness you showed has made
A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night

I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind, as you

I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there, for me

How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listened to the referee
As I was counted out

I thought my time was up
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind, as you

I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

How kind of you to think of me
How kind of you...

== Jenny Wren

[verse]
____
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart, took her soul away

Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world, and it's foolish ways

How, we, spend our days, casting, love aside
Loosing, site of life, day, by, day

She saw poverty, breaking all the home
Wounded warriors, took her song away

[Solo]

But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world, mends its foolish ways

Now we, spend our days, catching, up on life
All because of you, Jenny Wren

== At The Mercy

[verse]
____
At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road,
Who can handle such a heavy load?

At the mercy, At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day,
We can think of nothing more to say

If you show me love, I won't refuse
I know you'd never make me choose
Between the love I've got and the love I'd lose

Sometimes I'd rather run and hide,
Then stay and face the fear inside

At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day,
Who can bear to turn their head away?

At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
We can watch the universe explode

If you take me up, I won't say no
I guess you'd rather see me grow
Into a better man than the one you know

Sometimes my head is hanging low
It's time to get on with the show

At the mercy, at the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
I can think of nothing more to say 
____


== Friends To Go

[verse]
____
I've been waitin on the other side, for your friends to leave
So I don't have to hide, I prefer they didnt know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

I've been sliding down a slippery slope, I've been climbing
Up a slowly burning rope, but the flame is getting low
I've been waitin' on the other side, for your friends to go

You never need to worry about me, I'll be fine on my own
Someone else can worry about me
I've spent alot of time on my own
I've spent alot of time on my own

I've been waitin till the danger past, I don't know
How long the storm is gonna to last, if we're gonna carry on
I'll been waiting on the other side, till your friends are gone

So tell me what I wanna know
I'll be waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

[Solo]

Someone else can worry about me
I've spent alot of time on my own
I've spent alot of time on my own

I've been waiting on the other side
For your friends to leave so I don't have to hide
I prefer they didnt know
So I've been waiting on the other side, for your friends to go

I've been waiting on the other side

== English Tea

[verse]
____
Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning

What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

Miles of miles of English garden, stretching past the willow tree
Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively

Do you know the game crochet
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning

[Solo]

Miles of miles of English garden, stretching past the willow tree
Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively

As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes

== Too Much Rain

[verse]
____
Laugh, when your eyes are burning
Smile, when your heart is filled with pain

Sigh, as you brush away your sorrow
Make a vow, that's it's not going to happen again

It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

You, know the wheels keep turning
Why, do the tears run down your face

We, use to hide away our feelings
But for now, tell yourself it won't happen again

It's not right, in one life
Too much rain

It's too much for anyone, Too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life
You've gotta learn to laugh

[Guitar solo]

Smile, when your spinning round and round
Sigh, as you think about tomorrow
Make a vow, that your gonna be happy again

It's all right, in your life
No more rain

It's too much for anyone, Too hard for anyone
Who wants a happy and peaceful life 
____


== A Certain Softness

[verse]
____
A certain softness, in her eyes, facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softnesss)
More than I ever thought it could

A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

A kind of sadness in her smile, captivates me
Surer than anything that's sure (a kind of sadness)
Surer than anything before

A kind of sadness in her smile
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

If even can even find the words to tell
I wouldn't want to anyway
Cause that would only break the spell
And you know very well, I couldn't betray her

The touch of wildness, in her style, haunts my memory
More than I ever thought it would (a touch of wildness)
More than I ever though

A touch of wind in her style
Got me hooked
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

A certain softness, in her eyes, facinates me
More than I ever thought it would (a certain softnesss)
More than I ever thought it could

A certain softness in her eyes
Got me hooked
Got me hooked

== Riding To Vanity Fair

[verse]
____
I bit my tongue
I never talked too much
I tried to be so strong
I did my best
I used the gentle touch
I've done it for so long

You put me down
But I can laugh it off
And act like nothing's wrong
But why pretend
I think I've heard enough
Of your familiar song

I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll try to take my mind off you
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

You're not aware
Of what you put me through
But now the feeling's gone
But I don't mind
Do what you have to do
You don't fool anyone

I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I'll take a different point of view
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

The definition of friendship
Apparently ought to be
Showing support for the one that you love
And I was open to friendship
But you didn't seem to have any to spare
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

There was a time
When every day was young
The sun would always shine
We sang along
When all the songs were sung
Believing every line

That's the trouble with friendship
For someone to feel it
It has to be real or it wouldn't be right
And I keep hoping for friendship
But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

== Follow Me

[verse]
____
You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
I can rely on you, to guide me through, any situation
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me.

You give me direction, you show me the way
You give me a reason, to face every day
I can depend on you, to send me to, any destination
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me, follow me.

Down the track of lonelines, down the path of love
Through the words of heartache, to the end
On the shores of sorrow, where the waves of hope crash in
The perfect place for me to find a friend. ahh yeah yeah yeah, oh

You lead to places, that I've never been
Uncovering secrets, that I've never seen
I can rely on you, to guide me through, any situation
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me, follow me,
Follow me, follow me,
Follow me, follow me

== Promise To You Girl

[verse]
____
Looking through the backyard of my life
Time to sweep the fallen leaves away

[Chorus - harmonies]
Like the sun that rises every day
We can chase the dark clouds from the sky

I gave my promise to you girl, I don't wanna take it back
You and me, side by side, We know how to change the world
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl

Hey why wait another day, that won't get us anywhere
All the time, that ain't changed, to repair this brave old world
We'll be up, I gave my promise to you girl

[Chorus - harmonies]
Everything single second of our life
We can use to chase the clouds away

[Guitar Solo]

Well, there's no more barking up the tree, no more howling at the moon
Same old scene, you and I, diving for the deepest trust
That is why, I gave my promise to you girl

[Chorus - guitar]

[Chorus - oh woh]

Looking through the backyard of my life

== This Never Happened Before

[verse]
____
I'm very sure, this never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before

Now I see, this is the way it's supposed to be
I met you and now I see
This is the way it should be

This is the way it should be, for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when your on your own

So come to me, now we can be what we want to be
I love you and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be

This is the way it should be, for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when your on your own

I'm very sure, this never happened to me before
I met you and now I'm sure
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before

== Anyway

[verse]
____
If you love me, won't you call me
I've been waiting, waiting to long
In my soul is, constant yearning
Always singing, singing this song

Only love is strong enough, to take it on the chin
When did I begin, to fall

Anyway, Anyway, you can make, that call
You feel free, to make yourself, at home - woh-oh, ahhhhhh, ohhhhh

If we could be, closer longer
That would help me, help me so much
We can cure each other's sorrow
Won't you please, please, please get in touch

If our love is strong enough, it may never end
Why would I pretend, to fall, woo-ew

Anyway, Anyway, you can make, that call
You feel free, to make yourself, at home - woh-oh, ahhhhhh

Anyway, Anyway, Anyway, at all
Anyway, you can make that call
