== Say Say Say

(duet with Michael Jackson)

[verse]
____
Say, say, say what you want
But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction

All alone, I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for you dear?
You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh

Go, go, go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you stay away
So long girl, I see you never

What can I do
Girl to get through to you?
Cause I love you, baby
Standing here, baptisted in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh

You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face
These tears ain't drying

You, you, you can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray every day
That you'll see things, girl like I do

What can I do girl, to get through to you?
Cause I love you baby
Standing here baptised in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

== The Other Me

[verse]
____
I Know I Was A Crazy Fool
For Treating You The Way I Did
But Something Took Hold Of Me
And I Acted Like A Dustbin Lid

I Didn't Give Second Though
To What The Consequence Might Be
I Really Wouldn't Be Surprised
If You Were Trying To Find Another Me

The Other Me Would Rather Be The Glad One
The Other Me Would Rather Play The Fool
I Want To Be The Kind Of Me
That Doesn't Let You Down As A Rule

I Know It Doesn't Take A Lot
To Have A Little Self-Control
But Every Time That I Forgot
Well I Landed In Another Hole

But Everytime You Pull Me Out
I Find It Harder Not To See
That We Can Build A Better Life
If I Can Try To Find The Other Me

The Other Me Would Rather Be The Glad One
The Other Me Would Rather Play The Fool
I Want To Be The Kind Of Me
That Doesn't Let You Down As A Rule

But If I Ever Hurt You
Well You Know That It's Not Real
It's No Easy Living By Yourself
So Imagine How I Feel

I Wish That I Could Take It Back
I'd Like To Make A Different Mood
And If You Let Me Try Again
I'll Have A Better Attitude

Well I Know That One And One Make Two
And That's What I Want Us To Be
I Really Would Appreciate It
If You'd Help Me Find The Other Me

The Other Me Would Rather Be The Glad One
The Other Me Would Rather Play The Fool
I Want To Be The Kind Of Me
That Doesn't Let You Down As A Rule

== Twice In A Lifetime

[verse]
____
Now I know that it can easily happen
To someone like me
I don't want to step on anybody's toes

Who knows how to find love
Think before you give your answer
Who knows what a mystery may bring

Once in a life I'm a lucky man
If I can find the kind of love
That's gonna last for me

Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows when a mystery begins

I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows when a mystery begins

I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know
