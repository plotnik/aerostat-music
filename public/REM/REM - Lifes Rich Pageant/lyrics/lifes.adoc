== Begin The Begin

[verse]
____
Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand
The insurgency began and you missed it
I looked for it and I found it
Miles Standish proud, congratulate me

A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand
Of the power, the only vote that matters

Silence means security, silence means approval
Watchin' Zenith on the TV, tiger run around the tree
Follow the leader, run and turn into butter

Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again like Martin Luthers in
The mythology begins the begin

Answer me a question, I can't itemize
I can't think clearly, look to me for reason
It's not there, I can't even rhyme, begin the begin

A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Example, the finest example is you

Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand
The insurgency began and you missed it
I looked for it and I found it
Miles Standish proud, congratulate me

A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again

== These Days

[verse]
____
Now I'm not feeding off you
I will rearrange your scales if I can, and I can
Marching to the ocean, marching to the sea, I had a hat
I dropped it down and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever

I wish to meet each one of you
And you meet you, if I can, and I can
We have many things in common, name three (three, three, three)
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of a sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go

Now I'm not feeding off you
I will rearrange your scales if I can, and I can
I wish to meet each one of you, and you meet you
I had a hat and it sunk, reached down
Picked it up, slapped it on my head

All the people gather, fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you

Carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go

Carry each his burden, we are young despite the years
We are concern, we are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go
(Take away the scattered bones of my meal)
____

== Fall On Me

[verse]
____
There's the problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky, and tell the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)

There's the progress
We have found a way to talk around the problem
Building towered
Foresight isn't anything at all

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Don't fall on me
(Well I would keep it above but then it wouldn't be sky any more)
(So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home)

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky, and ask the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)

== Cuyahoga

[verse]
____
Let's put our heads together and start a new country up
Our father's father's father tried, erased the parts he didn't like
Let's try to fill it in, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red

This is where we walked
This is where we swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir

This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red
And we gathered up our friends, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, underneath the river bed

This is where we walked
This is where we swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir

Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Let's put our heads together and start a new country up
Up underneath the river bed we'll burn the river down

This is where they walked, swam
Hunted, danced and sang
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir

Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Rewrite the book and rule the pages
Saving face, secured in faith
Bury, burn the waste behind you

This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We are not your allies, we cannot defend

This is where they walked
This is where they swam
Take a picture here
Take a souvenir

Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone 
____

== Hyena

[verse]
____
Night time fell at the opening
In the final act of the beginning of time
Hyena, take your role, the stage is set
The town is safe again tonight

Hyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you)

Hyena, sister, look to your hand
Man, you serve communal interest
She'll tell you when and where and how and why you'd hurt
A beautiful young lady

Hyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you)

The only thing to fear is fearlessness
The bigger the weapon, the greater the fear
Hyena is ambassador to here

Nighttime fell like the closing
Meager pay, but recognition
Hyena crawls on his belly out
The town is safe again tonight

Hyena (I see the changes, man)
Hyena (going on across the way)
Hyena (I see my road ahead)
Hyena (don't know if I should stay)
Hyena (I see you holding him)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you) 
____

== Underneath The Bunker

[verse]
____
I will hide and you will hide
And we shall hide together here
Underneath the bunkers in the night

I have water, I have rum
Wait for dawn and dawn shall come
Underneath the bunkers in the night
____

== The Flowers Of Guatemala

[verse]
____
I've took a picture that I'll have to send
People here are friendly and content
People here are colorful and bright
The flowers often bloom at night

Amanita is the name
The flowers cover everything
The flowers cover everything

There's something here I find hard to ignore
There's something that I've never seen before
Amanita is the name, they cover over everything

The flowers cover everything
They cover over everything (Amanita is the name)
The flowers cover everything

Look into the sun
Don't look into the sun

The flowers cover everything
They cover over everything
The flowers cover everything

The flowers cover everything
They cover over everything
The flowers cover everything

There's something that I've never seen before
The flowers often bloom at night
Amanita is the name, they cover over everything
____

== I Believe

[verse]
____
When I was young and full of grace, and spirited a rattlesnake
When I was young and fever fell, my spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor not to tell

I believe in coyotes and time as an abstract
Explain the change, the difference between
What you want and what you need, there's the key
Your adventure for today, what do you do
Between the horns of the day

I believe
My shirt is wearing thin and change is what I believe in

When I was young and give and take, and foolish said my fool awake
When I was young and fever fell, my spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor, on your honor

Trust in your calling, make sure your calling's true
Think of others, the others think of you
Silly rule, golden words make practice, practice makes perfect
Perfect is a fault, and fault lines change

I believe
My humor's wearing thin and change is what I believe in
I believe
My shirt is wearing thin and change is what I believe in

When I was young and full of grace, and spirited a rattlesnake
When I was young and fever fell, my spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor, on your honor

I believe in example, I believe my throat hurts
Example is the checker to the key

I believe
My humor's wearing thin and I believe the poles are shifting
I believe
My shirt is wearing thin and change is what I believe in
____

== What If We Give It Away

[verse]
____
On the outside, underneath the wall
All the money couldn't buy
You're mistaken, no one's standing there
For the record, no one tried

Oh, I try to
What if we give it away?

Overlooking with a hollow eye
What's pretending isn't right
Eye for order, a hand for what's in line
Couldn't follow, couldn't write

Oh, I try to
What if we give it away?

And our life is fine here
Stitch it on your tie here

Here's the trailer, Tom
A year has come and gone
We're not moving, wasn't right
Take the order, sew it on your tie
We couldn't follow, couldn't try

Oh, I try to
What if we give it away?
What if we give it away? 
____

== Just A Touch

[verse]
____
Well, what in the world, women in black
Don't you remember, send us back
A day in the life, well, nobody laughed
Look to the days, how long can this last?

Kevin heard it on the radio
Hugh informed word of mouth
Carla read it in the news
Caught it all, just a touch

You set the pace of what was to come
I have to carry on now that you're gone
A day in the life, nobody laughed
Look to the days, how long can this last?

Kevin heard it on the radio
Hugh informed word of mouth
Carla read it in the news
Caught it all, just a touch

There's someone in our dreams
In our pre-assembled dream
Lord, Dave, William

Well, what in the world, women in black
Don't you remember, send the towering past back
A day in the life, well, nobody laughed
Look to the days, how long can this last

Kevin heard it on the radio
Hugh informed word of mouth
Carla read it in the news
Caught it all, just a touch

I can't see where to worship Popeye, love Al Green
I can't see, I'm so young, I'm so goddamn young
____

== Swan Swan H

[verse]
____
Swan, swan, hummingbird, hurrah
We are all free now
What noisy cats are we
Girl and dog, he bore his cross

Swan, swan, hummingbird, hurrah
We are all free now
A long, low time ago
People talk to me

Johnny Reb, what's the price of fans
Forty apiece or three for one dollar
Hey, captain, don't you want to buy
Some bone chains and toothpicks

Night wings, or hair chains?
Here's your wooden greenback, sing
Wooden beams and dovetail sweep
I struck that picture ninety times

I walked that path a hundred ninety
Long, low time ago
People talk to me

A pistol hot, cup of rhyme
The whiskey is water, the water is wine
Marching feet, Johnny Reb
What's the price of heroes?

Six and one, half dozen the other
Tell that to the captain's mother
Hey, captain, don't you want to buy
Some bone chains and toothpicks?

Night wings, or hair chains?
Swan, swan, hummingbird, hurrah
We are all free now
What noisy cats are we

Long, low time ago, people talk to me
A pistol hot cup of rhyme
The whiskey is water, the water is wine
