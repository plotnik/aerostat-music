== Radio Free Europe

[verse]
____
Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason: it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't Country at all

Radio station: decide yourself

Keep me out of Country and the word
Wheel of fortune's leading us: absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the floor
That this isn't nothing at all

Straight off the boat, where to go

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe (radio)

Decide: defy the media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't fortunate at all

Radio station: decide yourself

We're calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe (radio)

Decide yourself: come in on a boat
Media's too fast
Keep me out of Country and the word
Disappointment into us: absurd

Straight off the boat, where to go?

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe

== Gardening At Night

[verse]
____
I see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real

The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere
It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

The neighbors go to bed at ten
Call the prayer line for a change
The charge is changing every month
They said it couldn't be arranged

We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow

I see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

Your sister said that you're too young
She should know she's been there twice
The call was two and fifty-one
They said it couldn't be arranged

We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow

The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere
It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

== Talk About The Passion

[verse]
____
Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world

Talk about the passion, talk about the passion

Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion
Combien, combien, combien de temps

Talk about the passion, talk about the passion

Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Combien, combien, combien de temps

Talk about the passion, talk about the passion
Talk about the passion, talk about the passion
Talk about the passion, talk about the passion

== So. Central Rain

[verse]
____

Did you never call? I waited for your call
These rivers of suggestion are driving me away
The trees will bend, the cities wash away
The city on the river there is a girl without a dream
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Eastern to Mountain, third party call, the lines are down
The wise man built his words upon the rocks
But I'm not bound to follow suit
The trees will bend, the conversation's dimmed
Go build yourself another home, this choice isn't mine
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Did you never call? I waited for your call
These rivers of suggestion are driving me away
The ocean sang, the conversation's dimmed
Go build yourself another dream, this choice isn't mine
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry 
____

== (Don't Go Back To) Rockville

[verse]
____
Looking at your watch a third time
Waiting in the station for the bus
Going to a place that's far
So far away and if that's not enough
Going where nobody says hello
They don't talk to anybody they don't know

You'll wind up in some factory
That's full-time filth and nowhere left to go
Walk home to an empty house
Sit around all by yourself
I know it might sound strange but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

At night I drink myself to sleep
And pretend I don't care that you're not here with me
'Cause it's so much easier to handle
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

It's not as though I really need you
If you were here I'd only bleed you
But everybody else in town only wants
To bring you down and that's not how it ought to be
I know it might sound strange, but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year
Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year 
____

== Can't Get There

[verse]
____
When the world is a monster bad to swallow you whole
Kick the clay that holds the teeth in, throw your trolls out the door
If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go by dawn
Lawyer Jeff, he knows the lowdown, he's mighty bad to visit home

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here

When your hands are feeling empty, stick head jumpin' off the ground round
Tris is sure to shirr the deer out, Brother Ray can sing my song

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here

Hands down, Calechee bound, landlocked, kiss the ground
Dirt of seven continents going round and round
Go on ahead, Mr. Citywide, hypnotized, suit-and-tied
Gentlemen, testify

If your world is a monster bad to swallow you whole
Philomath, they know the lowdown, throw your trolls out the door

(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here
(I've been there I know the way) Can't get there from here

== Driver 8

[verse]
____
The walls are built up, stone by stone;
the fields divided one by one.
And the train conductor says,
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
we've been on this shift too long"

And the train conductor says,
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"
I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm.
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged.
Bells are ringing through the town again,
Children look up, all they hear is sky-blue, bells ringing

And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

Way to shield the hated heat.
Way to put myself to sleep.
Way to shield the hated heat.
Way to put myself, my children to sleep.

He piloted this song in a plane like that one.
She is selling faith on the Go Tell crusade.
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again.
Field to weed is lookin' thin

And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We've been on this shift too long."
And the train conductor says,
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break.
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away" 
____

== Romance

[verse]
____
Nations call
Par-parallels
Neighbors call
All in all in all in all in all

That's worth saving up for
Put our heads down on the chest
Mustn't even race for rest
Easy come, easy go

Easy come
Easy go
Easy come
Easy go

Stares conceal
Par-parallels
Neigh-neighbors call
All in all in all in all in all

That's worth saving up for
Put our heads down on the chest
Mustn't even race for rest
Easy come, easy go

Easy come
Easy go
Easy come
Easy go

Chance is yours
And call the shot
Even in a parking lot
With one romance
One romance

Easy come
Easy go
Easy come
Easy go

Neighbors call
Par-parallel
Late at night nations fall
All in all in all in all in all

That's worth saving up for
Put our heads down on the chest
Mustn't even race for rest
Easy come, easy go

Easy come
Easy go
Easy come
Easy go 
____

== Fall On Me

[verse]
____
There's the problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky, and tell the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)

There's the progress
We have found a way to talk around the problem
Building towered
Foresight isn't anything at all

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me)
Don't fall on me
(Well I would keep it above but then it wouldn't be sky any more)
(So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home)

Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky, and ask the sky
Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for)
Fall on me (if it's there for long)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me) 
____

== The One I Love

[verse]
____
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
A simple prop to occupy my time
This one goes out to the one I love

Fire
Fire

This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
A simple prop to occupy my time
This one goes out to the one I love

Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now)

This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
Another prop has occupied my time
This one goes out to the one I love

Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire (she's comin' down on her own, now)
____

== Finest Worksong

[verse]
____
The time to rise has been engaged
You'd better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone
I listen to the finest worksong

Your finest hour
Your finest hour

Another chance has been engaged
To throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time
I beg you not beg to rhyme

(Oh), Your finest hour
(Oh), Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins
You'd better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

== It's The End Of The World

[verse]
____
That's great! It starts with an earthquake,
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane;
Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.
World serves its own needs, don't mis-serve your own needs.
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no strength.
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of fight, down height.
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site.
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
With the furies breathing down your neck.

Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.
Look at that low plane! Fine, then.
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group,
But it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed.
Tell me with the rapture and the rev-'rent in the right, right.
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light;
Feeling pretty psyched.

It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

Six o'clock. TV hour.
Don't get caught in foreign tower.
Slash and burn, return,
Listen to yourself churn.
Lock him in uniform and book burning, bloodletting.
Ev'ry motive escalate. Automotive incinerate.
Light a candle, light a motive.
Step down, step down.
Watch a heel crush, crush.
Uh oh, this means no fear; cavalier.
Renegade and steer clear!
A tournament, a tournament,
A tournament of lies.
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
And I decline.

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
I feel fine

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

The other night I tripped a nice
Continental drift divide.
Mountains sit in a line.
Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev,
Lenny Bruce, and Lester Banks
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly beans, boom!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, right? (Right!)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
