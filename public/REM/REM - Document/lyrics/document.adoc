== Finest Worksong

[verse]
____
The time to rise has been engaged
You'd better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone
I listen to the finest worksong

Your finest hour
Your finest hour

Another chance has been engaged
To throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time
I beg you not beg to rhyme

(Oh), Your finest hour
(Oh), Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins
You'd better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused

(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour
(Oh) Your finest hour

== Welcome To The Occupation

[verse]
____
Hang your collar up inside
Hang your dollar on me
Listen to the water still
Listen to the cause where you are
Fed and educated,
Primitive and wild
Welcome to the occupation

Here we stand and here we fight
All your fallen heroes
Held and dyed and skinned alive
Listen to the Congress fire
Offering the educated
primitive and loyal
Welcome to the occupation

Hang your collar up inside
Hang your freedom higher
Listen to the buyer still
Listen to the Congress
Where we propagate confusion
Primitive and wild
Fire on the hemisphere below

Sugar cane and coffee cup
Copper, steel and cattle
An annotated history
The forest for the fire
Where we open up the floodgates
Freedom reigns supreme
Fire on the hemisphere below
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me

== Exhuming McCarthy

[verse]
____
You're beautiful, more beautiful than me
You're honorable, more honorable than me
Loyal to the Bank of America

(It's a sign of the times)
(It's a sign of the times)

You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

Vested interest, united ties
Landed gentry, rationalize
Look who bought the myth
By jingo, buy America

(It's a sign of the times)
(It's a sign of the times)

You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
Sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

Enemy sighted, enemy met
I'm addressing the real politic
Look who bought the myth
By jingo, buy America

"Let us not assassinate this man further, Senator, you've done enough.
Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"

You're sharpening stones, walking on coals
To improve your business acumen
sharpening stones walking on coals
To improve your business acumen

Enemy sighted enemy met
I'm addressing the real politic
You've seen start and you've seen quit (I'm addressing the table of content)
I always thought of you as quick

Exhuming McCarthy, exhuming McCarthy (meet me at the book burning)
Exhuming McCarthy, exhuming McCarthy (meet me at the book burning)

== Disturbance At The Heron House

[verse]
____
They're going wild, the call came in
At early morning predawn then
The followers of chaos, out of control

They're numbering the monkeys
The monkeys and the monkeys
The followers of chaos, out of control

The call came in to party central
A meeting of the green and simple
Trying to tell us something we don't know

They're meeting at the monument
The call came in, the monument
To liberty and honor under the honor roll

They've gathered up the cages
The cages and courageous
The followers of chaos, out of control

The call came in to party central
A meeting of the green and simple
Trying to tell us something we don't know

Disturbance at the Heron House
A stampede at the monument
To liberty and honor under the honor roll

Just a gathering of the grunts and greens
The cogs and grunts and hirelings
A meeting of a mean idea to hold

When feeding time has come and gone
They'll lose their heart and head for home
Try to tell us something we don't know
We don't know 
____

== Strange

[verse]
____
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh

There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's going to say goodnight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh

There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's going to say goodnight
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh

== It's The End Of The World As We Know It

[verse]
____
That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, and Lenny Bruce is not afraid

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with a fear of height, down, height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies breathing down your neck

Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crush, uh-oh
This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and I decline

It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
I feel fine (I feel fine)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

The other night I dreamt a nice continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)

== Fireplace

[verse]
____
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times
Crazy, crazy world
Crazy, crazy times

Hang up your chairs to better sweep
Clear the floor to dance
Shake the rug into the fireplace

Crazy, crazy world

Sweep the floor into the fireplace

Hang up your chairs to better sweep

Clear the floor to dance
Throw the walls into the fireplace.

== Lightnin' Hopkins

[verse]
____
When I lay myself to sleep
Pray that I don't go too deep
Lightnin' won, Lightnin' won
Because it's cold down, gold down there, crow

Flat lands low lands on the track
Shows the water, pan the track
Lightnin' won lightnin' won
Close up hands to silhouette, crow

(Oh, oh)
Lightnin' won, Lightnin' won
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Hound bark on the track
Hound crow hold onto your hat
Lightnin' won, Lightnin' won
Low lands, timberlands, bad lands, bird lands.

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh) 
____

== King Of Birds

[verse]
____
A thumbnail sketch, a jeweler's stone
A mean idea to call my own
Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point,
Point observation, children carry reservations

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold, leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly

Singer sing me a given
Singer sing me a song
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Everybody's looking on
(Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young,
there's time to teach, point to point,
point observation, children carry reservations)

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly away, away, away

I am king of all I see
My kingdom for a voice
Old man don't lay so still, you're not yet young
There's time to teach, point to point
Point observation, children carry reservations

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Leaves me cold, leaves me cold
A mean idea to call my own
A hundred million birds fly away, away, away

Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground
Everybody hit the ground

== Oddfellows Local 151

[verse]
____
Oddfellows Local 151 behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits to prove a sage, to teach
Peewee gathered up his proof, reached up to scratch his head
Fell down and hit the ground again

Firehouse
Firehouse

Why do the heathens rage behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach?
This boy and girl that gather pearls of wisdom
Falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood, wash off the rum

Firehouse

Oddfellows Local 151 behind the firehouse

Falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood, wash off the 151

Ooh, ooh, ooh
