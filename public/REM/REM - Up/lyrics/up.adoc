== Suspicion

[verse]
____
Now my suspicion's on the rise
I have known, I have known your kind.
Please don't talk, don't make me think
Order up another drink
Let me let imagination drive.

Can't you see
I need
Nothing too deep.

Imagination
Come alive
Suspicion
Tonight, I'll dream tonight.

Listen to the devils in my ear.
Tell me what, what I want to hear
You're so funny, you're so fine
You're so perfect, you're so mine.
That I never had an opportunity
To hide
No, I've never had a chance

Can't you see
I need
Nothing too deep.

Imagination come alive
Suspicion
Tonight, I'll dream tonight.

Look into my eyes.
They hypnotize.
The lights, the drinks.
Let the music carry you away

My eyes are blurred
My sights are limited
Am I sensing a familiar twinge?

Please don't speak
Make me think
It's all too deep

Imagination
Come alive
Suspicion
Step down, I'll dream tonight

Step down, I'll dream
You're so naked baby
Carry me away
Dream, dream.

== Hope

[verse]
____
You want to go out friday
and you want to go forever
you know that it sounds childish
that you've dreamt of alligators
you hope that we are with you
and you hope you're recognized
you want to go forever
you see it in my eyes
I'm lost in the confusion
and it doesn't seem to matter
you really can't believe it
and you hope it's getting better

you want to trust the doctors
their procedure is the best
but the last try was a failure
and the intern was a mess
and they did the same to Matthew
and he bled 'til sunday night
they're saying don't be frightened
but you're weakened by the sight of it
you lock into a pattern
and you know that it's the last ditch
you're trying to see through it
and it doesn't make sense
but they're saying don't be frightened
and they're killing alligators
and they're hog-tied and accepting of
the struggle

you want to trust religion
and you know it's allegory
but the people who are followers
have written their own story
so you look up to the heavens
and you hope that it's a spaceship
and it's something from your childhood
you're thinking don't be frightened

you want to climb the ladder
you want to see forever
you want to go out Friday
and you want to go forever
and you want to cross your DNA
to cross your DNA with something reptile
and you're questioning the sciences
and questioning religion
you're looking like an idiot
and you no longer care
and you want bridge the schizm,
a built-in mechanism to protect you.
and you're looking for salvation
and you're looking for deliverance
you're looking like an idiot
and you no longer care
'cause you want to climb the ladder
you want to go forever
and you want to go out friday
you want to go forever

== At My Most Beautiful

[verse]

I've found a way
a way to make you smile

into your machine
I save your messages
just to hear your voice.
you always listen carefully
to awkward rhymes.
you always say your name.
like I wouldn't know it's you,
at your most beautiful.

I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
a way to make you smile

at my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly.
with every one, whisper I love you.
I let you sleep.
I know your closed eye watching me,
listening.
I thought I saw a smile.

I've found a way
a way to make you smile

== The Apologist

[verse]
____
They call me the apologist
and now that I'm at peak
you know at first it really hurt
we joke about these things
I've skirted all my differences
but now I'm facing up
I wanted to apologize for
everything I was… so
I'm sorry, so sorry…

did you understand me right?
the people here are good
they tell me what I should have done
and offer what I could
I'm good, all is good
all's well, no complaints
when I feel regret,
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm sorry, so sorry…

I live a simple life
unfettered by complex sweets
you think this isn't me?
don't be weak
there I go
I'm so sorry

thank you for being there for me
thank you for listening, goodbye
I can forfeit selfishness
i hope for you that you apply
this happiness
this peacefullness
I'm sorry, so sorry

I live a simple life
unfettered by complex sweets
you think this isn't me?
that's so sweet
I'm so sorry

== Sad Professor

[verse]
____
If we're talking about love
Then I have to tell you
Dear readers, I'm not sure where I'm headed.
I've gotten lost before.
I've woke up stone drunk
Face down in the floor.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.

This may be a lit invention
Professors muddled in their intent
To try to rope in followers
To float their malcontent.
As for this reader,
I'm already spent.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.

Dear readers, my apologies.
I'm drifting in and out of sleep.
Long silence presents the tragedies
Of love. Note the age. Get afraid.
The surface hazy with attendant thoughts.
A lazy eye metaphor on the rocks.

Late afternoon, the house is hot.
I started, I jumped up.
Everyone hates a bore.
Everybody hates a drunk.
Everyone hates a sad professor.
I hate where I wound up.
I hate where I wound up.

== You're In The Air

[verse]
____
You wanted a challenge that's calling you higher
I landed on my feet by crawling
I remember standing alone trying to forget you idling
I hate to admit that that's my reference point
But there it is you say you want me

I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air, you're in the air and I am breathing

Brighten the stars
The weather is lifting the heavens love a love like this
It's pulling you higher twist it and turn this around
It lights from within it dribbles your chin
Now brings a smile, I'm lost again
I'm lost again

I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air, you're in the air and I am breathing you

I want the stars to know they've won if only to beguile
The sky has opened up again in heavens reconciled
I want you naked, I want you wild, I want the stars to know they win
Give me that smile, just give it me, just turn it on, I'm lost again

I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air
I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're in the air
I'm what you found, I'm upside down
You're everywhere, you're in the air and I am breathing you

== Walk Unafraid

[verse]
____
As the sun comes up, as the moon goes down
These heavy notions creep around
It makes me think, long ago
I was brought into this life a little lamb
A little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name.
But somewhere there I lost my way
Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step
The narrow path they've laid
They claim to
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold me love me or leave me high.

Say "keep within the boundaries if you want to play."
Say "contradiction only makes it harder."
How can I be
What I want To be?
When all I want to do is strip away
These stilled constraints
And crush this charade
Shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up and
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold me love me or leave me high.

If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
Look me in the eye
And if you see familiarity
Then celebrate the contradiction
Help me when I fall to
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love or leave me high.
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold me love me or leave me high.

== Why Not Smile

[verse]
____
The concrete broke your fall
to hear you speak of it
I'd have done anything
I would do anything
I feel like a cartoon brick wall
to hear you speak of it
you've been so sad
it makes me worry
why not smile?
you've been sad for a while.
why not smile?

I would do anything
to hear you speak of it.
why not smile?
you've been sad for a while.
you've been sad for a while.

== Daysleeper

[verse]
____
Receiving department, 3 A.M.
Staff cuts have socked up the overage
Directives are posted, no callbacks, complaints
Everywhere is calm

Hong Kong is present, Taipei awakes
All talk of circadian rhythm

I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache gray
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper

The bull and the bear are marking their territories
They're leading the blind with their international glories

I am the screen, the blinding light
I'm the screen, I work at night

I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache gray
Don't wake me with so much
Daysleeper

I cried the other night
I can't even say why
Fluorescent flat caffeine lights
It's furious balancing

I am the screen, the blinding light
I'm the screen, I work at night

I see today with a newsprint fray
My night is colored headache gray
Don't wake me with so much

The ocean machine is set to 9
I'll squeeze into heaven and Valentine
My bed is pulling me, gravity
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper
Daysleeper

== Parakeet

[verse]
____
You wake up in the morning
and fall out of your bed
mean cats eat parakeets
and this one's nearly dead.
You dearly wish the wind would shift
and greasy window slide
open for the parakeet
who's colored bitter lime.

Open the window
and lift into your dreams
lately, baby
you can barely breathe.

A broken wrist
an accident
you know that something's wrong
you fold the leavings of your past
no one knows you've gone.
The sunspot flares of the early
nineties light up your wings.
And scan the shortwave radio
it's tracking outer rings.

The techtonic dispatcher shifts
to smooth the ocean floor
and flattens out to warmer winds
of Brisbane's sunny shore.
Where Buddhas tend to mending wrists
a tea made from the leaves
of eucalyptus fragrances
and coriander seeds.

You wake up in the morning
to warm Pacific breeze
where mean cats chew licorice
and cannot climb the trees.

Open your window
and lift into a dream
baby, baby
baby starts to breathe

== Falls To Climb

[verse]
____
I'll take the position
Assume the missionary part
You work by committee,
You had me pegged from the start.
I'll be pounce pony,
Phoney maroney,
Pony before the cart.
I'll be pounce pony.
This ceremony
Only fills my heart.

Who cast the final stone?
Who threw the crushing blow?
Someone has to take the fall
Why not me?

A punch toy volunteer
A weakling on its knee.
Is all you want to hear
And all you want to see.
Romantically, you'd martyr me
And miss this story's point
It is my strength, my destiny
This is the role that I have chosen.

Who cast the final stone?
Who threw the crushing blow?
Someone has to take the fall
Why not me?

Gentlemen mark your opponents
Fire into your own ranks.
Pick the weakest as strategic
Move. Square off. To
Meet your enemy.
For each and every gathering
A scapegoat falls to climb.
As I step forward, silently.
Deliberately mine.

Who cast the final stone?
Who threw the crushing blow?
Someone has to take the fall
Why not me? Why not me.
Had consequence chose differently
Had fate its ugly head
My actions make me beautiful
And dignify the flesh

Me. I am free. Free.
