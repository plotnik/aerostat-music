== The Ship

[verse]
____
The Ship was from the willing land
The waves about it roll

And as aglow by powdered sand
We lift, we loot, we haul

The time is still
The sky is young
Drawn on towards the goal
And we are as the undescribed
To take and lose control

Oh hallelujah, pray for me,
the man who turned away.

My desert in a grain of sand.
My life within a day.

So smooth the stones that count the tides,
the piper plays a reed.

But we are as the undefined,
breaking of the wing.

When pray with time at memory day
And pray the tie told
The sail is down the wind is gone
The sky is blessed with growth
The slave to host a pistody
Illusion of control
And we are as the unrefined
The wake about to roll

"Can I take the freedom and forget you?
How can it, form contractions
Don't talk that I'm frightened
Do I know exactly my husband?
That I Love You. We miss you, after that
Go get brethren (grab her then)
I still act"

== Fickle Sun (ii) The Hour Is Thin

[verse]
____
The hour is thin.
Trafalgar Square is calm.
Birds and cold black dark, the final famine of a wicked sun.
And the web that died yesterday.

I was a hard-copy version, I turned my eyes directly to hate.
Then, the hammer of toil.
Tired of what the world has yet brought forth, with the women waving at war, and the news that war is faith.
Filled with tremendous cheering, leaping, and night rings. Ding, dang, and gongs.
Who did not feel any purpose?

The phoenix broods, serene above the moment.
You are fighting for, I wonder what, destiny.

We waste away our hours and darken.
Beneath the velvet of a strong optimism.
Britain's most fateful hour is spun.

Copy this point on a gong.

Choirs, like bells, like a national truce.
And the new sun, where the air is something new.
Men dream of a swell so high, endeavor to get through the lies and the bees to find something that historians can rake out of the drums.
And all that color and savagery.
Boom, the dark.
And the web that died yesterday.

The phoenix broods serene above the tower of time, not enough boats.
He admitted without shame that he had entered into the dreams of the named addressee in the velvet of war.

Well lad, you've taken my heart away. I shall miss the heart of the cold, black sea.
Before ever there was writing, they were taking up stones to hurl at last stroke, but nobody looked back.

There were soldiers, there was a cradle.

The universe is required. Please notify the sun.

== Fickle Sun (iii) I'm Set Free

(originally by Velvet Underground)

[verse]
____
I've been set free and I've been bound
To the memories of yesterday's clouds
I've been set free and I've been bound

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I've been blinded but
Now I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walk right by me

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

I've been set free and I've been bound
Let me tell you people
what I found
I saw my head laughing
rolling on the ground

And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
