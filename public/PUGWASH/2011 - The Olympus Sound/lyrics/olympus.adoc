[verse]
____
Oh the isolation it's a sticky situation in my mind
Every conversation has a different destination to be found

After being to heaven I can't even count to 7 at a time
Life has done me over and the thought has knocked me sober
It's a crime

Chorus
Where can I go from here (where can I go?)
Where can I go from here (where can I go?)
Answers on a postcard

Common equilibrium is swinging like a pendulum around
Silence is the enemy serenity's a memory unfound

I cannot believe that when my heart is on my sleeve I am alive
Calling me a masochist when really I'm a pacifist gone wild
____

== There You Are

[verse]
____
All I want is to begin with 'A'
Look to the future and celebrate but I can't...
I just can't
I gotta stop gotta let it all go
Get a new me from my head to my toes but I can't...
I just can't

Chorus
('Cause everywhere I look) There you are!
('Cause every night I dream) There you are!

My feet of clay never hit the ground
Don't wanna be a man that can't be found but I am...
Yes I am
The moon is warm and the sun is cold
I want to live a life before I get old but I'm not...
No I'm not

Chorus

I wanna stop all this vitriol
It's not condusive to a loving soul but I can't...
I just can’t
All I want is to begin with 'A'
Look to the future and celebrate but I can't...
I just can't
____

== To the Warmth of You

[verse]
____
Why must the world laugh at my woes?
Sneering obscenely at every faux-pas
All that I dream is all I need
Such a shame my soul doesn't feel the same

Seasons pass faster than fruitflies
Decades disolving like solpadeine
Pity my heads not aching now
Such a shame my heart is the opposite way

Chorus
Bring me home... besides the fire
Take me back... to waiting for you
See the world... through my youth again
Bring me home... to the warmth of you

Why must the birds fly south on me?
Just when I need them to sing me to sleep
All of this silence hurts my ears
Such a shame that the wind doesn't whistle a tune
____

== Fall Down

[verse]
____
If I should fall to pieces
If I should crawl on my hands and knees
No one try and help me out
I'm the only one seeing the light disappearing

If I ask some questions
That I want all the answers to
No one try help me out
I’m the only one dreaming of night reappearing

Chorus
Oh why do I fall down, fall down
Oh why do I fall down, fall down

If I fail again
I have only myself to blame
So no one try and help me out
I'm the only one here that can help with the healing

Chorus

No one try and help me out
I'm the only one here who can help with the healing

Chorus
____

== Be My Friend Awhile

[verse]
____
In the middle of a bad one, when the sun has gone away
And the pillow at my head is concrete grey

I can see a new beginning, I can feel it in my bones
But it's taken me so long to shake off this cold

Bridge
’Cause she's the one that tore me up inside
And the one who stole my valentines
But you can have me for a song and a smile
If you'll only be my friend awhile

Chorus
Be my friend awhile, be my friend awhile
Be my friend awhile, be my friend awhile

Looking back over the good times
Through the laughter and the tears
All this reverie I hold is pure and sincere

But reality was peering like a vista blackened hue
And my soul was taken from me, slowly by you

Bridge
She’s the one that tore me up inside
And the one who stole my valentines
But you can have me for a song and a smile
If you'll only be my friend awhile
____

== Dear Belinda

[verse]
____
Dear Belinda
'Cause you've done it all, yet you are still so young
Dear Belinda, Dear Belinda

Nobody told you there'd be days like these
When you were starting out
You shone like the moon and then you said
Goodnight as a sweetheart, as a sweetheart

Where will you go?
What will you do from here?
Dear Belinda
'Cause you've done it all, yet you are still so young
Dear Belinda, Dear Belinda

And as you look around you today
You'll see all your friends are here
To show you how much you mean to them
In every single way
Dear Belinda

Where will you go?
What will you do from here?
Dear Belinda
'Cause you've done it all, yet you are still so young
Dear Belinda, Dear Belinda
____

== 15 Kilocycle Tone

[verse]
____
15 kilocycle tone - only you can hear me
15 kilocycle tone - only you can hear me

15 kilocycle tone - only you can hear me
15 kilocycle tone - only you can hear me

When you hear me say the word
You can tell it to the world
Don't be shy

15 kilocycle tone - only you can hear me
15 kilocycle tone - only you can hear me

When you hear me say the word
You can tell it to the world
Don’t be shy

15 kilocycle tone

== I Don't Like it But I Gotta Do It

[verse]
____
I don't like it but I’ve gotta do it...
In many ways I don't mind
I don't like it but I’ve gotta do it...
Even if it is unkind

And it's a chore, such a bore
Oh why?

I don't like it but I've gotta do it...
It's 24 hours a day
I don't like it but I've gotta do it...
For me to change my ways

And it's a chore, such a bore
Oh why?

Life is glue until it turns to ice overnight
And you won’t see the signs
Oh why?

I don’t like it but I've gotta do it...
____

== Here We Go 'Round Again

[verse]
____
Everybody knows our world is spinning all around our sun
But why can't we feel when our hearts are being broken
And see when our lives have been taken apart?

Everybody knows the time even when they're lost at sea
But why can't we tell when it's time to move on
And to love what is right and to leave what is wrong?

Chorus
God only knows
(And you know that he knows everything)
When words can't express how we feel
(So just you shut your mouth and sing)
Ba-ba-ba-ba here we go round again

Everybody knows to run when April showers tumble down
But why can't we feel when it's up to our knees
When it's splashing about then it's time to get out

Everybody knows to care for people who have fallen down
But why can't we help get ourselves off the ground
When we're crawling around with no dignity found?

Chorus

Here we go round, here we go round again
(Like a dog chases horses on a carousel)
Here we go round, here we go round again
(Like a clock with no hands only time will tell)
Here we go round, here we go round again
(Stirring up a whirlpool in a wishing well)
Here we go round, here we go round again...

== Such Beauty Thrown Away

[verse]
____
Everywhere you go about this world
Everytime you smile your flag unfurls
You're fine... but I need to say I'll never understand
Such beauty thrown away
Such beauty thrown away

Every night your thoughts they fill my sky
If you dare to dream you'll see me cry
I'm fine... but I need to say I'll never understand
Such beauty thrown away
Such beauty thrown away

You will never know what you did to me
How you made me feel as meek as a lamb
As meek as a lamb
You gambled with my heart

I'm fine... but i really need to say I'll never understand
Such beauty thrown away
Such beauty thrown away
____

== See You Mine

[verse]
____
The pain of springtime, a summer off my mind
Then autumn turned in to a winter from you
But now you're back around, I’m happiness abound
My world is singing a familiar tune...

Everybody needs someone
Who will share in the pain of a life undone

Boy I love you
In a day, In a day
Everything I knew had tumbled out of sight
And out of mind
I knew that I would see you mine

Of all the silly things I thought I'd do without
I never knew it would be looking at you
But now you're back around, I’m happiness abound
My world is singing a familiar tune...

Everybody needs someone
Who will share in the pain
Of a life undone
____

== Four Days

[verse]
____
Four days
Wandered around
Felt I was walking on mistletoe
Four days
Lay in my bed
Ranted and raved at the video

Nobody knows
It's a pain you can't kill with a Panadol
One day I may tell you all but for now...
I'll just smile

Four days
Don't do clothes
Set my alarm for the sunset
Four days
Hid from the world
My curtains were bars made of linenette

Nobody knows
It's a pain you can't kill with a Panadol
One day I may tell you all but for now...
I'll just drink

Four days
That was as long I thought I could do without you
I was wrong
So wrong

Four days...
