== The Last Of The Irish Rover

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Irish+Rovers+lyrics+The+Last+Of+The+Irish+Rover

[verse]
____
In the Year of our Lord Eighteen Hundred and Six
We set sail from the cold cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand City Hall in New York
She was a wonderful craft, she was rigged 'fore and aft
And lord how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts, and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrels of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in the fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord, what a shock
We nearly tumbled over
Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover

== Star Of The County Down

[verse]
____
Near Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July
Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín
And she smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
Such a winsome elf, I'm ashamed of myself
For to see I was staring there

	From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
	From Galway to Dublin Town
	No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
	That I met in the County Down

As she onward sped, sure I scratched me head
And I looked with a feelin' rare
And I says, says I, to a passer-by
"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair"?
Well, he looked at me and he said to me:
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the star of the County Down"

	From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
	From Galway to Dublin Town
	No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
	That I met in the County Down

She'd soft brown eyes with a look so shy
And a smile like the rose in June
And she sang so sweet what a lovely treat
As she lilted an Irish tune
At the Lammas dance I was in the trance
As she whirled with the lads of the town
And it broke me heart just to be apart
From the star of the County Down

	From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
	From Galway to Dublin Town
	No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
	That I met in the County Down

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
So I'll dress in me Sunday clothes
With me shoes shone bright and me hat cocked right
For a smile from the nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough is a rust colored brown
And a smiling bride by me own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down

== Bonnets Of Bonnie Dundee

[verse]
____
Tae the Lords o' convention 'twas Claverhouse spoke
E'er the King's Crown go down there are crowns to be broke
So each caviler who loves honor and me
Let him follow the bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee

Come fill up my cup, come fill up can
Come saddle my horses and call out my men
Unhook the West Port and let us gae free
For it's up with the bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee

Dundee he is mounted and rides up the street
The bells tae ring backwards, the drums tae are beat
But the provost douce man says, 'Just let it be'
When the toon is well rid o' that devil Dundee

Come fill up my cup, come fill up can
Come saddle my horses and call out my men
Unhook the West Port and let us gae free
For it's up with the bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee

There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth
Be there lords in the south, there are chiefs in the north
There are brave downie wassles three thousand times three
Cry hey for the bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee

Come fill up my cup, come fill up can
Come saddle my horses and call out my men
Unhook the West Port and let us gae free
For it's up with the bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee

Then awa tae the hill to the lee and the rocks
Ere I own a usurper I'll crouch with the fox
So tremble false wigs in the midst of yer glee
For you've no seen the last of my bonnets and me

Come fill up my cup, come fill up can
Come saddle my horses and call out my men
Unhook the West Port and let us gae free
For it's up with the bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee

== Liverpool Lou

[verse]
____
Oh, Liverpool Lou, lovely Liverpool Lou
Why can't you behave just like the other girls do?
Why must my poor heart be following you
Stay home and love me, my Liverpool Lou

When love is pleasing, and love is teasing
And love is a pleasure, when first it is new love
As love it grows it older, and love it grows colder
And fear is the way love, like the more I need you

Oh, Liverpool Lou, lovely Liverpool Lou
Why can't you behave just like the other girls do?
Why must my poor heart be following you
Stay home and love me, my Liverpool Lou

When I go a-walking, I hear people talking
School children playing, I know what they're saying
They're saying you'll grieve me, that you will deceive me
Some morning you'll leave me all packed up and gone

Oh, Liverpool Lou, lovely Liverpool Lou
Why can't you behave just like the other girls do?
Why must my poor heart be following you
Stay home and love me, my Liverpool Lou

== The Gypsy Rover

[verse]
____
The gypsy rover came over the hill
And down through the valley so shady
He whistled and he sang
Till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady

Ah di doo ah di doo dah day
Ah di doo ah de da-a-y
He whistled and he sang
Till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady

She left her father's castle gate
She left her own fond lover
She left her servants and her estate
To follow the gypsy rover

Ah di doo ah di doo dah day
Ah di doo ah de da-a-y
He whistled and he sang
Till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady

Her father he saddled up his fastest steed
And he roamed the valleys all over
He sought his daughter at great speed
And the whistling gypsy rover

Ah di doo ah di doo dah day
Ah di doo ah de da-a-y
He whistled and he sang
Till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady

He came at last to a mansion fine
Down by the river clade
And there was music, and there was wine
For the gypsy and his lady

Ah di doo ah di doo dah day
Ah di doo ah de da-a-y
He whistled and he sang
Till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady

Well he's no gypsy my father she said
But lord of these lands all over
And I will stay till me dying day
With my whistling gypsy rover

Ah di doo ah di doo dah day
Ah di doo ah de da-a-y
He whistled and he sang
Till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady

== Muirsheen Durkin

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Irish+Rovers+lyrics+Muirsheen+Durkin

[verse]
____
In the days when I was courting, I was never tired resorting
To the alehouse and the playhouse, and the other house besides.
But I told my brother Seamus, "I'll be off now and grow famous
And before that I return again, I'll roam the whole world wide."
So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

Well, I've courted girls in Blarney, in Antrim and Killarney,
In Dublin and in Kerry, down to the coves of Cork.
But I'm tired of all this pleasure, so now I'll take my leisure.
And the next time that you hear from me, I'll write you from new York.

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

When I landed in America, I met a man named Burke.
He told me if I'd stay a while, he'd surely find me work.
But work he didn't find me, so there's nothing here to bind me.
I'm bound for San Francisco, in Califor-ni-yay!

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.
Well, I'm now in San Francisco, and my fortune it is made.
My pockets loaded down with gold, I'll throw away my spade.
I'll go back to dear old Erin, spend my fortune never carin'.
I'll marry Queen Victori', Mrs. Durkin for to spite.

So, it's goodbye Mrs. Durkin, I'm sick and tired of workin'.
No more I'll dig your praties, no longer I'll be poor.
As sure as my name is Barney, I'm off to Califarny.
Instead of digging praties, I'll be digging lumps of gold.

== Come By The Hills

[verse]
____
Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea
Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day is done

Oh, come by the hills to the land where life is a song
And sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day is done

Come by the hills to the land where legend re-mains
Where stories of old fill the heart and may yet come a-gain
Where our past has been lost and the future has still to be won
Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day is done

== The Gallant Forty-Twa

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Irish+Rovers+lyrics+The+Gallant+Forty-Twa

[verse]
____
You may talk about your Lancers or your Irish Fusiliers
The Aberdeen Militia or the Queen's own Volunteers
Or any other regiment that's lying far awa'
Come give to me the tartan of the Gallant Forty Twa
And strolling through the green fields on a summer day
Watching all the country girls working at the hay
I really was delighted and he stole my heart awa'
When I saw him in the tartan of the Gallant Forty Twa

I never will forget the day his regiment marched past
The pipes they played a lively tune but my heart was aghast
He turned around and smiled farewell and then from far awa'
He waved to me the tartan of the Gallant Forty Twa
And strolling through the green fields on a summer day
Watching all the country girls working at the hay
I really was delighted and he stole my heart awa'
When I saw him in the tartan of the Gallant Forty Twa

Once again I heard the music of the pipers from afar
They tramped and tramped the weary men returning from the war
And as they nearer drew I brushed a woeful tear awa'
To see my bonnie laddie of the Gallant Forty Twa
And strolling through the green fields on a summer day
Watching all the country girls working at the hay
I really was delighted and he stole my heart awa'
When I saw him in the tartan of the Gallant Forty Twa
I really was delighted and he stole my heart awa'
When I saw him in the tartan of the Gallant Forty Twa

== No Nay Never

[verse]
____
I've been a wild rover for many a year
And I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I swear I'll will play a wild rover no more

And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
Will I play a wild rover, no never no more

I went into an ale house I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit but she answered me nay
Said a custom like yours I can have anyday

And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
Will I play a wild rover, no never no more

Then I took from me pocket a handful of gold
And on the round table it glittered and rolled
Well, the landlady smiled as she served me the best
What I told you before sure it was only in jest

And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
Will I play a wild rover, no never no more

I'll go home to me parents confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon there prodigal son
And if they'll forgive me as off time before
Well, I never will play a wild rover no more

And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
Will I play a wild rover, no never no more

And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
Will I play a wild rover, no never no more

== Whiskey On A Sunday

[verse]
____
Come day, go day
Wish in me heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk through the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

He sits in the corner of old beggar's bush
On top of an old packing crate
He has three wooden dolls
That can dance and can sing
And he croons with a smile on his face

Come day, go day
Wish in me heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk through the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

His tired old hands tug away at the strings
And the puppets dance up and down
A far better show than you ever would see
In the fanciest theatre in town

Come day, go day
Wish in me heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk through the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

And sad to relate that old Seth Davy died in 1904
The three wooden dolls in the dustbin were laid
His song will be heard nevermore

Come day, go day
Wish in me heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk through the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

But some stormy night when you're passing that way
And the wind's blowing up from the sea
You'll still hear the song of old Seth Davy
As he croons to his dancing dolls three

Come day, go day
Wish in me heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk through the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

Come day, go day
Wish in me heart it were Sunday
Drinking buttermilk through the week
Whiskey on a Sunday

== Farewell To Carlingford

[verse]
____
When I was young and in my prime
And could wander wild and free
There was always a longing in my heart
To follow the call of sea

So I'll sing farewell to Carlingford
And farewell to Greenore
I'll think of both day and night
Until I return once more
Until I return once more

On all of the stormy seven seas
I have sailed before the mast
But on every voyage I ever made
I swore it would be my last

Now I have a girl called Mary Doyle
And she lives in Greenore
And the foremost thought was in her mind
To keep me safe on the shore

Now a landsman's life is all his own
He can go or he can stay
But when the sea gets in your blood
When she calls you must obey

== I'm A Rambler, I'm A Gambler

[verse]
____
I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, then leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
And the moonshine don't kill me, I'll live 'til I die

I've been a moonshiner for many a year
I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
I'll go to some hollow, I'll set up my still
And I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, then leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
And the moonshine don't kill me, I'll live 'til I die

I'll go to some hollow in this country
Ten gallons of wash, I will go on a spree
No women to follow, the world is all mine
I love none so well as I love my moonshine

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, then leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
And the moonshine don't kill me, I'll live 'til I die

It's moonshine for Molly and moonshine for May
Moonshine for me love, she'll sing all the day
It's moonshine for breakfast and moonshine for tea
It's moonshine, me hearties, it's moonshine for me

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, then leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
And the moonshine don't kill me, I'll live 'til I die

Well, moonshine, dear moonshine, oh, how I love thee
You killed me ould father, but ah you try me
I'll bless all moonshiners and bless all moonshine
Their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me, then leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
And the moonshine don't kill me, I'll live 'til I die

== The Unicorn

[verse]
____
A long time ago when the earth was green
And there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen
They'd run around free while the earth was being born
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn

There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn

Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain
And He says "Stand back, I'm going to make it rain"
He says "Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...

Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
Don't you forget My Unicorn"

Old Noah was there to answer the call
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started falling
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through, "Hey Lord, I got your..."

Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn
I just can't see no Unicorn"

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring
Oh, them silly Unicorns

There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Noah cried "Close the door, cause the rain is pouring
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn"

The ark started moving, it drifted with the tide
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day

You'll see green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
You're never gonna see no Unicorn 
____

== The Orange And The Green

[verse]
____
Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Oh, my father was an Ulsterman, proud Protestant was he
My mother was a Catholic girl, from County Cork was she
They were married in two churches, lived happily enough
Until the day that I was born and things got rather tough

Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Baptised by father Reilly, I was rushed away by car
To be made a little orangeman, my father's shining star
I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that
To my father I was William while my mother called me Pat

Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

With mother every Sunday to mass I'd proudly stroll
Then after that the orange lads would try to save my soul
For both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because
I played the flute or played the harp, depending where I was

Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

One day my ma's relations came round to visit me
Just as my father's kinfolk were all sittin' down to tea
We tried to smooth things over, but they all began to fight
And me being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight

Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Now my parents never could agree about my type of school
My learning was all done at home, that's why I'm such a fool
They both passed on, god rest them, but left me caught between
That awful color problem of the orange and the green

Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Yes, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

== Lilly The Pink

[verse]
____
We'll drink a drink a drink
To Lily the pink the pink the pink
The savior of the human race
She invented medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case

Here's a story, a little bit gory
A little bit happy, a little bit sad
Of Lily the Pink and her medicinal compound
And how it slowly drove her to the bad

Meet Ebenezer, thought he was Julius Caesar
So they put him in a home
And then they gave him medicinal compound
And now he's Emperor of Rome

We'll drink a drink a drink
To Lily the pink the pink the pink
The savior of the human race
She invented medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case

And Freddie Clinger, the opera singer
Who could break glasses with his voice they said
So on his tonsils he rubbed medicinal compound
And now they break glasses over his head

Meet Johnny Hammer had a t-t-terrible s-s-stammer
He could b-barely say a word
So they gave him medicinal compound
And now he's seen, but never heard

We'll drink a drink a drink
To Lily the pink the pink the pink
The savior of the human race
She invented medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case

And Uncle Paul, he was very small. He
Was the shortest man in town
So on his body he rubbed medicinal compound
And now he's six foot, but it's underground

Lily died and went up to heaven
Oh, the church bells they did ring
She took with her medicinal compound
Hark the herald angels sing

We'll drink a drink a drink
To Lily the pink the pink the pink
The savior of the human race
She invented medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case

We'll drink a drink a drink
To Lily the pink the pink the pink
The savior of the human race
She invented medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case

== The Bonnie Lass Of Fyvic

[verse]
____
There once was a troop of Irish Dragoons
Came marchin' down through Fyvie'o
And the captain fell in love wi' a very bonnie lass
Her name it was called pretty Peggy'o

There's manys a bonnie lass in the town of Auchterlass
There's manys a bonnie lassie in ol' Gairioch
There's manys a bonnie Jean in the streets of Aberdeen
But the flower of them all live in Fyvie'o

Come down the stairs, pretty Peggy my dear
Come down the stairs pretty Peggy'o
A come down the stairs, comb back yer yellow hair
Say a lang farewell to yer mammy'o

The colonel he cried, "Mount!"
"Mount, boys, mount!"
The captain he cried, "Tally-ho!"
And tallied for a while for another day or twa
'Till I see if this bonnie lass will marry'o

'Twas early next morning when we marched to war
And oh! But our captain he was sorry'o
The drums they did beat o' the merry braes o' Gight
And the pipes played the Bonnie Lass of Fyvie'o

Long ere we came tae Bethelnie toon
We had our captain to carry'o
And long ere we came to the town of Aberdene
We had our captain to burry'o

Green grow the birks on bonnie Ythanside
And low lie the lowlands of Fyvie'o
Our captain's name was Ned and he died for a maid
He died for the chamber maid of Fyvie'o

[verse]
____
Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
Through the streets in my kilt I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your trousers?

I've just come down from the isle of Skye
I'm no very big an' I'm awfully shy
The lassies say as I go by
Donald, where's your trousers?

Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
Through the streets in my kilt I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your trousers?

Now I went to a fancy ball
And it was slippery in the hall
And I was feared that I might fall
For I hadnae on me trousers

Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
Through the streets in my kilt I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your trousers?

Now I went down to London town
To have a little fun on the underground
The ladies turn their heads around
Saying, Donald, where are your trousers?

Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
Through the streets in my kilt I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your trousers?

The lassies love me every one
But let them catch me if they can
You cannae take the breeks off a Hielan' man
Donald, where's your trousers?

Let the wind blow high, let the wind blow low
Through the streets in my kilt I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your trousers?

== Mountain Tay

[verse]
____
Gather up the pots and the old tin can
The mash, the corn, the barley and the bran
Run like the devil from the excise man
Keep the smoke from rising, Barney

Mountain breezes as they blow
Hear their echo in the glen below
The excise men are on the go
In the hills of Connemara

Keep your eyes well peeled today
The big, tall men are on their way
Searching for the mountain tay
In the hills of Connemara

A gallon for the butcher, a quart for Tom
A bottle for poor old Father John
To help his prayers and hymns along
In the hills of Connemara

Stand your ground boys, it's too late
The excise men are at the gate
Glory be to Paddy, but they're drinking it straight
In the hills of Connemara

Swing to the left and swing to the right
The excise men will dance all night
Drinking up the tay till the broad daylight
In the hills of Connemara 
____

== Sweet Strabane

[verse]
____
If I were King of Ireland
And all things at my will
I'd roam through all creation
New fortunes to find still
And the fortune I would seek the most
You all must understand
Is to win the heart of Martha
The flower of sweet Strabane

Her cheeks they are a rosy red
Her hair a golden brown
And o'er her snow white shoulders
It carelessly falls down
She is the fairest lassie
You'll find throughout the land
And my heart is captivated by
The flower of sweet Strabane

If I had you lovely Martha
Away in Innisowen
Or in some lonesome valley
In the wild woods of Tyrone
I would use my best endeavour
And try to work my plan
For to win the prize and feast my eyes
On the flower of sweet Strabane

Now I'll go o'er the Lagan
By steam ships on the tide
I'm sailing for Amerikay
Across the ocean wide
My boat is bound for Liverpool
Down by the Isle of Man
So farewell and God bless you Martha
My flower of sweet Strabane

[verse]
____
As I got down to Turra market, Turra market for to fee
I fell in with a wealthy farmer, the barnyards of Delgaty

A linten addie toorin addie, linten addie toorin ae
Linten lowrin lowrin lowrin, the barnyards of Delgaty

He promised me the one best horse that e′er I set my eyes upon
When I got to the barnyards, there was nothing there but skin and bone

A linten addie toorin addie, linten addie toorin ae
Linten lowrin lowrin lowrin, the barnyards of Delgaty

As I go down to church on Sunday, many's the bonnie lass I see
Sitting by her mothers side, winkin′ over the pews at me

A linten addie toorin addie, linten addie toorin ae
Linten lowrin lowrin lowrin, the barnyards of Delgaty

Now, I can drink and no be drunken, I can fight and no be slain
I can court with another mans lass and still be welcome to me ain

A linten addie toorin addie, linten addie toorin ae
Linten lowrin lowrin lowrin, the barnyards of Delgaty

Now, I can drink and no be drunken, I can fight and no be slain
I can court with another mans lass and still be welcome to me ain

A linten addie toorin addie, linten addie toorin ae
Linten lowrin lowrin lowrin, the barnyards of Delgaty

Ah, now my candle is burnt oot, my snotter's fairly on the wane
Fare ye well ye barnyards, you'll never see me here again

A linten addie toorin addie, linten addie toorin ae
Linten lowrin lowrin lowrin, the barnyards of Delgaty

== Young Roddy McCorley

[verse]
____
Oh see the fleet foot host of men
Who sped with faces wan
From farmstedt and from fishers cot
Along the banks of Bann
They come with vengeance in their eyes
Too late, too late are they
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today

Up the narrow streets he steps
He smiling proud and young
About the hemp rope 'round his neck
The golden ringlets clung
There's never a tear in his blue eyes
Both glad and bright are they
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today

When the last stepped up the street
His shining pike in hand
Behind him marched in grim array
A stalwart earnest band
For Antrim town, for Antrim town
He led them to the fray
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today

There's never a one of all your dead
More bravely fell in fray
Than he who marches to his fate
On the bridge Toome today
True to the last! True to the last!
He treads the upward way
For young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Toome today

== Tied Up With A Black Velvet Band

[verse]
____
In a neat little town they called Belfast
Apprentice to trade, I was bound
And many's the hour of sweet happiness
Oh, I spent in that neat little town
'Til bad misfortune came over me
That caused me to stray from the land
Far away from my friends and relations
To follow the black velvet band

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds
You will think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band

As I went walkin' down broadway
Not meaning to stay very long
I met with a frolic some damsel
As she came a-dropping the lone
A watch she pulled out of her pocket
She slipped it right into me hands
Then the law came and put me in prison
Bad luck to her black velvet band

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds
You will think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band

Next morning before judge and jury
The both of us had to appear
And the judge said, "Majorly, I prefer a law"
The case against you is quite clear
And seven long years transportation
You're goin' to Van Diemen's land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds
You'll think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band

So come on, all ye dummy young fellows
You should all take a warning from me
And when ever you're out on the liquor, me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
They'll fill you with whisky and porter
Until you are not able to stand
And the very next thing that you know, me lads
You'll be sent off to Van Diemen's land

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds
You will think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Piled up with a black velvet band

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds
You will think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band

== My Boy Willie

[verse]
____
It was early, early in the spring
When my love Willy went to serve the king
And all that vexed him or grieved his mind
Was the leavin' of his dear girl behind

Oh, father dear, built me a boat
That on the ocean I might float
And the view the ships, as they pass me by
And to inquire, of my sailor boy

She had not sailed long in the deep
When a fine ships crew, she changed to meet
And of the captain she inquired to
Does my love Willy sail on board with you?

What sort of lad, is your Willy fair?
What sort of clothes does your Willy wear?
He wears a coat of the royal blue
And you'll easily know him, for his heart is true

If that's your Willy, he is not here
I doubt he's drowned, as we do fear
't was at yonder green island, as we passed by
It was there we lost a fine sailor boy

Oh, dig my grave long, wide, and deep
Put a marble stone at my head and feet
And in the middle, a turtle dove
So the whole world knows, that I died for love

== The Lovely Isle Of Innishfree

[verse]
____
I've met some folks who say that I'm a dreamer
And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say
But sure a body's bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away
And precious things are dreams onto an exile
They take him o'er the land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree

And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city wondrous tho' it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Innisfree

I wander o'er green hills thro' dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home, and tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf fire gathered
On bended knees their rosary is told

But dreams don't last
Tho' dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality
But tho' they paved the footways here with gold dust
I still would choose the Isle of Innisfree

And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

I will build my love a tower
Near yond pure crystal fountain
And on it I will buy her
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

Yes, my true love she was gone
I would surely find another
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Will you go lassie, go?

== Rolling Home To Ireland

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Irish+Rovers+lyrics+Rolling+Home+To+Ireland

[verse]
____
I come from Paddy’s land; I’m a rake and ramblin’ man 
Since I was young, I’ve had the urge to roam 
So don’t you weep for me. When I’m sailing on the sea 
For you won’t see me till I come rolling home 
Rolling home to Ireland, rolling home across the sea 
Back to me own con-ter-ree (country) 
Two thousand miles behind us and a thousand more to go 
So fill the sails and blow winds blow! 

We sailed away from Cork; We were headed for New York 
I’d always dreamed the sailor’s life for me 
But the days were hard and long; With no women, wine, or song 
And it wasn’t quite the fun I’d thought ‘twould be 
Rolling home to Ireland, rolling home across the sea 
Back to me own con-ter-ree (country) 
Two thousand miles behind us and a thousand more to go 
So fill the sails and blow winds blow! 

We weren’t too long a-sail; When the wind became a gale 
Our boat was tossed and turned upon the foam 
With waves like moutains high; Well I thought that I would die 
I wished to God that I was rolling home 
Rolling home to Ireland, rolling home across the sea 
Back to me own con-ter-ree (country) 
Two thousand miles behind us and a thousand more to go 
So fill the sails and blow winds blow! 

And when I reach the shore; I will go to sea no more 
There’s more to life than sailing ‘round the Horn 
Good luck to sailor men; When they’re headed out again 
I wish them all safe harbor from the storm 
Rolling home to Ireland, rolling home across the sea 
Back to me own con-ter-ree (country) 
Two thousand miles behind us and a thousand more to go 
So fill the sails and blow winds blow!

== Wasn't That A Party

[verse]
____
Could've been the whiskey
It might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six packs, I don't know
But look at the mess I'm in
My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party

Someone took a grapefruit
He wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talking to my old tom cat
They were talking about hockey
And the cat was talking back
Long about then everything went black
Wasn't that a party

I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Cutting down my neighbor's tree

Could've been the whiskey
It might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six packs, I don't know
But look at the mess I'm in
My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party?

Billy, Joe and Tommy
Well, they went a little far
They were sitting in the backyard, blowing on a siren
From somebody's police car

So you see, your honor
It was all in fun
The little bitty track meet down on main street
Was just to see if the cops could run
Well, they run us in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
I sure can use those 30 days
To recover from the party

Could've been the whiskey
It might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six packs, I don't know
But look at the mess I'm in
My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party

Could've been the whiskey
It might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six packs, I don't know
But look at the mess I'm in
My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party

Wasn't that a party
Wasn't that a party
Whoa, what a party
Wasn't that a party
Aww, what a part
Wasn't that a party
Oh, what a party
Whoa, wasn't a party
Hmm, what a party
Wasn't that a party
Wasn't that a party

Thank you, thank you, thank you very much, thank you very much
I appreciate ladies and gentlemen
Thank you, thank you very much
I'm leaving the building
