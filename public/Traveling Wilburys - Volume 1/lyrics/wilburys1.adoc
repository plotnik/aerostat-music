== Handle With Care

[verse]
____
Been beat up and battered 'round
Been sent up, and I've been shot down
You're the best thing that I've ever found

Handle me with care
Reputations changeable
Situations tolerable
But baby, you're adorable
Handle me with care
I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care

Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on

I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled
I've been robbed and ridiculed
In day care centers and night schools
Handle me with care

[Guitar Solo]

Been stuck in airports, terrorized
Sent to meetings, hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized
Handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care

Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on

I've been uptight and made a mess
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess
Oh, the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care

== Dirty World

[verse]
____
He love your sexy body, he loves your dirty mind
He loves when you hold him, grab him from behind
Oh baby, you're such a pretty thing
I can't wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang

You don't need no wax job, you're smooth enough for me
If you need you oil changed I'll do it for you free
Oh baby, the pleasure would be all mine
If you let me drive your pickup truck and park it where the sun don't shine

Every time he touches you his ass stands up on end
His legs begin to quiver and his mind begins to bend
Oh baby, you're such a tasty treat
But I'm under doctor's orders, I'm afraid to overeat

He love your sense of humor, your disposition too
There's absolutely nothing that he don't love about you
Oh baby, I'm on my hands and knees
Life would be so simple if I only had you to please

Oh baby, turn around and say goodbye
You go to the airport now and I'm going home to cry
He loves your...

== Rattled

[verse]
____
Oh yeah
Well, I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep
I get rattled, baby, o-over you

Yeah, I get twisted, I get turned around
I get twisted, and I'm up then I'm down
I get twisted, baby, o-over you

Well, baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control
It looks like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul

I'm twisted - shaken - rattled (grrrwl)

I get rattled, baby, over you

[Guitar solo]

Rattled Baby, over you

Well, baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control
It looks like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul

I'm twisted - shaken - rattled (grrrwl)
I get rattled, baby, o-over you

Oh, I get shaken, I'm torn up by the roots
Yeah, I'm shakin', way down in my boots
I get rattled, baby, over you
Yeah, I get rattled, baby, over you
Yeah I'm rattled, baby, over you

== Last Night

[verse]
____
She was there at the bar, she heard my guitar
She was long and tall, she was the queen of them all
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night

She was dark and discreet, she was light on her feet
We went up to her room and she lowered the boom
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night

Down below they danced and sang in the street
While up above the walls were steaming with heat
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night

I was feeling no pain, feeling good in my brain
I looked in her eyes, they were full of surprise
Last night, talking about last night
Last night, talking about last night

I asked her to marry me she smiled and pulled out a knife
The party's just beginning she said, "Your money or you life?"
Last night, talking about last night
Last night, talking about last night

Now I'm back at the bar, she went a little too far
She done me wrong, all I got is this song
Last night, thinking about last night
Last night, thinking about last night

== Not Alone Anymore

[verse]
____
You always said that I'd be back again
That I'd come running to you in the end
I thought that you were on your own
And now I find you're not alone

I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more

You always said that I would know someday
Just how it feels when your love walks away
I let you down, I let you go
I lost you, how was I to know

I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more

I never knew I could feel this way
I never could see past yesterday
You feel that everything is gone
I feel it too, you're not alone

I'll see you through the rain
Every heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone any more, any more, any more 
____

== Congratulations

[verse]
____
Congratulations for breaking my heart
Congratulations for tearing it all apart
Congratulations you finally did succeed
Congratulations for leaving me in need

This morning I looked out my window and found
A bluebird singing but there was no one around
At night I lay alone in my bed
With an image of you goin' around in my head

Congratulations for bringing me down
Congratulations now I'm sorrow bound
Congratulations you got a good deal
Congratulations how good you must feel

I guess that I must have loved you more than I ever knew
My world is empty now cause it don't have you
And if I had just one more chance to win your heart again
I would do things differently but what's the use to pretend

Congratulations for making me wait
Congratulations now it's too late
Congratulations you came out on top
Congratulations you never did know when to stop

Congratulations

== Heading For The Light

[verse]
____
I've wandered around with nothing more than time on my hands
I was lost in the night with no sight of you
And at times it was so blue and lonely
Heading for the light

Been close to the edge, hanging by my fingernails
I've rolled and I've tumbled through the roses and the thorns
And I couldn't see the sign that warned me, I'm
Heading for the light

Ooh - I didn't see that big black cloud hanging over me
And when the rain came down I was nearly drowned
I didn't know the mess I was in
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway

I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change
And I get the strangest feeling, as I'm
Heading for the light

[solo]

Ooh - my hands were tired
Jokers and fools on either side
But still I kept on till the worst had gone
Now I see the hole I was in
My shoes are wearing out from walking down this same highway

I don't see nothing new but I feel a lot of change
And I get the strangest feeling, as I'm
Heading for the light

I see the sun ahead, I ain't never looking back
All the dreams are coming true as I think of you
Now there's nothing in the way to stop me
Heading for the light

Now there's nothing in the way to stop me
Heading for the light
____

== Margarita

[verse]
____
Mar--ga--rita, ah
Mar--ga--rita, ah
Ooh

It was in Pittsburgh, late one night
I lost my hat, got into a fight
I rolled and tumbled, till I saw the light
Went to the big apple, took a bite

Still the sun went down your way
Down from the blue into the gray
Where I stood I saw you walk away
You danced away

I asked her what we're gonna do tonight
She said "Cahuenga Langa-Langa-Shoe Box Soup"
We better keep tryin' till we get it right
Tala mala sheela jaipur dhoop

She wrote a long letter on a short piece of paper

Mar--ga--rita

== Tweeter And The Monkey Man

[verse]
____
Tweeter and the Monkey Man were hard up for cash
They stayed up all night selling cocaine and hash
To an undercover cop who had a sister named Jan
For reasons unexplained she loved the Monkey Man

Tweeter was a boy scout before she went to Vietnam
And found out the hard way nobody gives a damn
They knew that they found freedom just across the Jersey Line
So they hopped into a stolen car took Highway 99

And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

The undercover cop never liked the Monkey Man
Even back in childhood he wanted to see him in the can
Jan got married at fourteen to a racketeer named Bill
She made secret calls to the Monkey Man from a mansion on the hill

It was out on thunder road - Tweeter at the wheel
They crashed into paradise - they could hear them tires squeal
The undercover cop pulled up and said "Everyone of you's a liar
If you don't surrender now it's gonna go down to the wire"

And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

An ambulance rolled up, a state trooper close behind
Tweeter took his gun away and messed up his mind
The undercover cop was left tied up to a tree
Near the souvenir stand by the old abandoned factory

Next day the undercover cop was-a hot in pursuit
He was taking the whole thing personal
He didn't care about the loot
Jan had told him many times it was you to me who taught
In Jersey anything's legal as long as you don't get caught

And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

Someplace by Rahway prison they ran out of gas
The undercover cop had cornered them said "Boy, you didn't think that this could last"
Jan jumped out of bed said "There's someplace I gotta go"
She took a gun out of the drawer and said "It's best if you don't know"

The undercover cop was found face down in a field
The monkey man was on the river bridge using Tweeter as a shield
Jan said to the Monkey Man "I'm not fooled by Tweeter's curl
I knew him long before he ever became a Jersey girl"

And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

Now the town of Jersey City is quieting down again
I'm sitting in a gambling club called the Lion's Den
The TV set was blown up, every bit of it is gone
Ever since the nightly news show that the Monkey Man was on

I guess I'll go to Florida and get myself some sun
There ain't no more opportunity here, everything's been done
Sometime I think of Tweeter, sometimes I think of Jan
Sometimes I don't think about nothing but the Monkey Man

And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

== End Of The Line

[verse]
____
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, doing the best you can
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand

You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring (End of the Line)
Waiting for someone to tell you everything (End of the Line)
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring (End of the Line)
Maybe a diamond ring

Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
Well it's all right, As long as you got somewhere to lay
Well it's all right, everyday is Judgment Day

Maybe somewhere down the road aways (End of the Line)
You'll think of me, wonder where I am these days (End of the Line)
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays (End of the Line)
Purple haze

Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line

Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive (End of the Line)
I'm glad to be here, happy to be alive (End of the Line)
It don't matter if you're by my side (End of the Line)
I'm satisfied

Well it's all right, even if you're old and gray
Well it's all right, you still got something to say
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive

Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
