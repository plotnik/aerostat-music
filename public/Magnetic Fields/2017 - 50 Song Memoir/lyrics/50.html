<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">In Saint Thomas, barefoot Beatniks bonk
On a boat, afloat in rum
Is it there I&#8217;m from?
I wonder where I&#8217;m from

Up in Yonkers, two blocks from the Bronx
Baby born 'bout as big as your thumb
Is it there I&#8217;m from?
I wonder where I&#8217;m from

Never stayed in any one place two years
I was made in America, three cheers!
Until

Baden-Baden, in the BRD
Lederhosen on my baby bum
Is it there I&#8217;m from?
I wonder where I&#8217;m from

Rarely stayed in one place more than a year
I was made in the northern hemisphere

Oh, the seashells, tossed up on the shore
Contain the oceanic hum
They know where they&#8217;re from
I wonder where I&#8217;m from
I wonder where I&#8217;m from</pre>

<h2 id="_67_come_back_as_a_cockroach">'67: Come Back As A Cockroach</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">Be nice or come back as a cockroach
Think twice before being cruel
Those who are unlawful
Will be something awful
When the wheel of life revolves
Flesh dissolves

Behave or demons will devour you
They crave the meat of bad boys
They find most delicious
The fresh flesh of vicious
Tots who would deny the lamb
What a scam

How could one come back as a cockroach?
Why would a spirit eat meat?
I was a dyspeptic
Epileptic skeptic
Other kids ask why at two
I still do

I want to come back as a cockroach
Or haunt some drafty mansion
I&#8217;m the type of chil&#8217;n
Wants to be the villain
Always separate from the pack
Dressed in black

I&#8217;m still a dreadful goody-goody
Won&#8217;t kill an innocent flea
From the time I began
I was mostly vegan
Let that little cockroach be
Don&#8217;t kill me</pre>

<h2 id="_68_a_cat_called_dionysus">'68: A Cat Called Dionysus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">We had a cat called Dionysus
Everyday another crisis
I used to keep him in my box
Where I kept my toys and blocks

He hated me
But I loved him

Whenever Dionysus saw me
He would arch his back and hiss and claw me
As soon as he could, he got loose
Across the roofs of Syracuse

Away from me
But I loved him

Meows

I kept him in the little chest
Where I was keeping all the rest

He hated me
Cause I loved him</pre>

<h2 id="_69_judy_garland">'69: Judy Garland</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">The first brick the drag king threw
To draw blood from the boys in blue
Said "Here lies Judy Garland" on it
It flew through historic air
Even Taylor Mead was there
And Allen Ginsberg wrote a sonnet

One day after the funeral
Stones flew over the Stonewall
Judy Garland
Halfway through her tell-all memoirs
Who flew up into the stars?
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free

We tried to drive to Woodstock but
Our little blue bug couldn&#8217;t cut
Through that last hundred miles of traffic
Love still dared not to speak
In l&#8217;année érotique
"Je t&#8217;aime" was banned as pornographic

So put those feather boas on
Drink too much wine
And celebrate the revolution
Of '69

Cause life-sized life never was enough
Who called reality&#8217;s bluff?
Judy Garland
Patron saint, or victim of love?
Let&#8217;s try "none of the above"
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free

Some say its a coincidence
No relation
As if she didn&#8217;t die for us
Her love nation

Halfway through 1969
Who joined Heaven&#8217;s conga line?
Judy Garland
Sick and tired of being alive
She flew back to Rigel V
Judy Garland

Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
So be free with me
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
So be free with me</pre>

<h2 id="_70_theyre_killing_children_over_there">'70: They&#8217;re Killing Children Over There</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">So we went to see the Jefferson Airplane
Our Dada was the opening act
Grace Slick was young and angry
She said "My fellow freaks, it&#8217;s a fact

They&#8217;re killing children over there
They&#8217;re killing children over there
I know we&#8217;re not supposed to care
But they&#8217;re still killing children over there"

Back then I was even younger than Grace Slick
Even for my age I was small
I thought she meant a massacre
Was taking place inside that hall

They&#8217;re killing children over there
They&#8217;re killing children over there
I know we&#8217;re not supposed to care
But they&#8217;re still killing children over there

Now that everyone is fat and complacent
I haven&#8217;t heard a protest in years
We just keep paying our taxes
The taxes keep turning the gears

They&#8217;re killing children over there
They&#8217;re killing children over there
I know we&#8217;re not supposed to care
But they&#8217;re still killing children over there</pre>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">I think I&#8217;ll make another world
And fill it with whatever I want
No one can say I can or can&#8217;t

I can see it now

I think I&#8217;ll make another world
It may not start out very large
But no one else will be in charge
I can see it now
I can see it now

And we will dance in the all
Like we were very small
Through the air through the night
And through the marble hall

No one can say that&#8217;s all wrong
Cause I&#8217;ll say get out of my song

Cause I can see another world
And I can make it with my hands

Who cares if no one understands
I can see it now

And moving by itself
And talking in its own way
Its realer than the old wives?</pre>

Hippie central, I could hop to the beach
Sometimes we would hitchhike
Miles to school, school being a figure of speech
Where we sang (kahuli aku, kahuli mai)

We lived on a zendo
In the forest, silence for days on end
Caught up on my reading
Huckleberry Finn was my only friend

It could have been paradise
But for the horrible bugs
I could have gone to a real school
But for the murderous thugs
In the forest of paradise
We gathered magic mushrooms
But mostly I sat around
In rooms as quiet as tombs
It was heaven

My mother took up with
A trumpeter, red-bearded, pork pie hat
Found a lyric of mine
He took it home and set music to that
To impress my mother
He stole my song. Better back off, mister
Fast forward two decades
Same thing happened but with Shakespeare&#8217;s sister

Why should it be paradise?
That&#8217;s just a place people go
It was home for a little while
But you can give me the snow
Give me the snow

My friend Shell was named for
A shell on the beach. She spoke pidgin English
Everyday I swam out
Onto the reef, catching exotic fish

Establishing a so-called moral science

Proverbial tail not between my legs

Information ethics, cyberethics — both since taken —
Said: Maximize the information flow
Toward a hypothetical end state in which the cosmos
Consists entirely of our info
And at the highest level possible, not only data
But data about data dot dot dot
Or life on top of life on top of life, et cetera

This heart is big enough for both of us
But you&#8217;re three thousand miles away

(Three thousand miles away)
(Three thousand miles away)

There&#8217;s something big enough for both of us
It&#8217;s part of my anatomy
You know I&#8217;d love to give it all to you
And you can have it all for free

First time I saw you, I could feel a stir
Down in my special body part
I would like you to take it in your hand
But please be careful, it&#8217;s my heart

(Three thousand miles away)
(Three thousand miles away)
(Three thousand miles away)

This thing is big enough for both of us
It throbs with love enough for two
Bet on the seasons to keep changing
Just like I keep on loving you</pre>

<h2 id="_14_i_wish_i_had_pictures">'14: I Wish I Had Pictures</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">I wish I had pictures of every old day
Cause all these old memories are fading away
There used to be pictures, but they faded too
Or got lost in the hubbub, or I&#8217;d show them to you

Of all my old lovers, folks I used to know
And those I still care for, who died long ago
The glamorous cities, each cute little town
The trees turning purple and yellow and brown

If I were an artist, with charcoal and pad
I&#8217;d make my own pictures of each day I&#8217;ve had
If I were a poet, I&#8217;d know the right word
I&#8217;d make it pretty, and grand, and absurd
If I were an actor, with just a wisecrack
Or some little gesture, I&#8217;d bring it all back

But I&#8217;m just a singer; it&#8217;s only a song
The things I remember are probably wrong
I wish I had pictures of every old day
Cause all these old memories are fading away
All these old memories are fading away
All these old memories are fading away
All these old memories are fading away</pre>

<h2 id="_15_somebodys_fetish">'15: Somebody&#8217;s Fetish</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">Everybody&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s fetish
Whether grand dame or cutely coquettish
Mainly like Mame or "No, No, Nanette"-ish
Everybody&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s fetish

Every persuasion has its adherents
Whether you pitch or run interference
If you&#8217;re forte is brains or appearance
Every persuasion has its adherents

Nothing&#8217;s too strange for somebody&#8217;s palate
Some spank the maid and some wank the valet
Some want to be struck down with a mallet
Nothing&#8217;s too strange for somebody&#8217;s palate

Everything is somebody&#8217;s perversion
One finger in or total submersion
Some need control and some want coercion
Everybody&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s fetish

And I, even I, with my wildebeest&#8217;s face
My eccentricities and my freedom from grace
Even for me has Cupid found a place
At last

One man&#8217;s poison is another man&#8217;s meat
Some go for inches and some go for feet
Some want the music and some like the beat
One man&#8217;s poison is another man&#8217;s meat

Everyone is somebody&#8217;s fancy
From 23rd Street down to Delancey
Whether by science or necromancy
Nothing&#8217;s so weird that nobody does it

And I, who have wandered alone for so long
On my little island just like King Kong
Here at the end I have written a song
For you</pre>
