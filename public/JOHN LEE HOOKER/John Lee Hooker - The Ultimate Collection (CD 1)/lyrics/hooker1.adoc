== Boogie Chillen'

[verse]
____
Well my mama she didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night long, oh Lord
Well my mama didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night long
I didn't care what she didn't 'low, I would boogie-woogie anyhow

When I first came to town people, I was walkin' down Hastings Street
Everybody was talkin' about, the Henry Swing Club
I decided I drop in there that night
When I got there, I say, "Yes, people"
They was really havin' a ball!
Yes, I know
Boogie Chillen'!

One night I was layin' down,
I heard mama 'n papa talkin'
I heard papa tell mama, let that boy boogie-woogie,
It's in him, and it got to come out
And I felt so good,
Went on boogie'n just the same

== Frisco Blues

[verse]
____
I left my heart in San Francisco

High on the hill, at the Golden Gate, 'cross the bay,
In San Francisco, on the hill, the mornin' fog,
And the cool, cool night
That's where, I wanna be, San Francisco
That's where my heart
Up in New York City,
I've been to Chicago,
But found no place, like San Francisco,
With the cable car, high, high, on the hill
In the mornin' fog,
The evening breeze,
The cool, cool night,
Is where I wanna be
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Work, work people, tell me about it,
Work out, work out
I got the blues for San Francisco
Yes, yes, yes, yes

My heart is there, high, on the hill,
Right down by, the Golden Gate, 'cross the bay,
That's where I wanna be
I left my heart right there, in San Francisco
With the mornin' fog and the cool, cool night, the cable cars, on the hill
That's where I wanna be people,
My heart is there, my heart is there, in San Francisco

== It Serves Me Right To Suffer

[verse]
____
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
Because you’re still livin’
in days done past and gone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
Just why, just why, just why
You can keep me fine
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
It serves me right to suffer
It serves me right to be alone
Your doctor put you on milk, cream and alcohol
you can’t sleep at night
Every time you see a woman
she makes you think of yours
Everytime you see a woman
she make you think of your own
She treated you so bad
Every time I see a woman
She makes me feel alone
Everytime you see a woman
she make you think of your own
She treated you so bad
Umm, umm, mmm, you’re still livin’ in the days
Done gone past and gone and memories
You can’t live on in that way, in the past
Them days is gone, gone
