One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

And then I sit there, gettin' high, mellow
Knocked out, feeling good and by the time
I looked on the wall at the old clock on the wall
By that time, it was ten thirty daddy

I looked down the bar, at the bartender
He said, "Now what do you want Johnny?"

One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

Well my baby she gone, she been gone two night

I wanna get drunk till I'm off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

And I sat there, gettin' high, stoned
Knocked out, and by the time
I looked on the wall, at the old clock again
And by that time, it was a quarter to two

Last call for alcohol, I said,
Hey mister bartender, what do you want? "

One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer

== I Cover The Waterfront

[verse]
____
I cover the waterfront, watchin' the ship go by
I could see, everybody's baby, but I couldn't see mine
I could see, the ships pullin' in, to the harbor
I could see the people, meetin' their loved one
Shakin' hand, I sat there,
So all alone, coverin' the waterfront

And after a while, all the people,
Left the harbor, and headed for their destination
All the ships, left the harbor,
And headed for their next destination
I sat there, coverin' the waterfront

And after a while, I looked down the ocean,
As far as I could see, in the fog, I saw a ship
It headed, this way, comin' out the foam
It must be my baby, comin' down
And after a while, the ship pulled into the harbor,
Rollin' slow, so cripple
And my baby, stepped off board
I was still, coverin' the waterfront

Said "Johnny, our ship had trouble, with the fog
And that's why we're so late, so late
Comin' home, comin' down'
