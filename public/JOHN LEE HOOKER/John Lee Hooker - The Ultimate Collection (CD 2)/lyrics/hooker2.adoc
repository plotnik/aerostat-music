== Let's Go Out Tonight

[verse]
____
Well my mama she didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night long, oh Lord
Well my mama didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night long
I didn't care what she didn't 'low, I would boogie-woogie anyhow

When I first came to town people, I was walkin' down Hastings Street
Everybody was talkin' about, the Henry Swing Club
I decided I drop in there that night
When I got there, I say, "Yes, people"
They was really havin' a ball!
Yes, I know
Boogie Chillen'!

One night I was layin' down,
I heard mama 'n papa talkin'
I heard papa tell mama, let that boy boogie-woogie,
It's in him, and it got to come out
And I felt so good,
Went on boogie'n just the same

== I Cover The Waterfront

[verse]
____
I cover the waterfront, watchin' the ship go by
I could see, everybody's baby, but I couldn't see mine
I could see, the ships pullin' in, to the harbor
I could see the people, meetin' their loved one
Shakin' hand, I sat there,
So all alone, coverin' the waterfront

And after a while, all the people,
Left the harbor, and headed for their destination
All the ships, left the harbor,
And headed for their next destination
I sat there, coverin' the waterfront

And after a while, I looked down the ocean,
As far as I could see, in the fog, I saw a ship
It headed, this way, comin' out the foam
It must be my baby, comin' down
And after a while, the ship pulled into the harbor,
Rollin' slow, so cripple
And my baby, stepped off board
I was still, coverin' the waterfront

Said "Johnny, our ship had trouble, with the fog
And that's why we're so late, so late
Comin' home, comin' down'

== She's Mine (Keep Your Hands To Yourself)

[verse]
____
Keep your hand to yourself, she belong to me
Keep your hand to yourself, she belong to me
All mine, she's all mine
Leave her alone!
Hands off!
Hands down!

All mine
She's my baby
I love her
She's gonna love me
Oh baby
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Now look buddy, keep your hand down, to yourself
It's all mine, all my property
Don't belong to you
Hands down, and eyes open
Oh baby, you're mine
Oh baby, all mine
All mine!

== Think Twice Before You Go

[verse]
____
Think twice before you go, baby, this will be the end
Think twice before you go, baby, this will be the end
You done leave me one time, baby you'll leave again

Dig in and suffer with me, an' I know you paid your dues
Dig in and suffer with me baby, an' I know you paid your dues
You done leave me when I need you, then I know you stand accused

Doing the man who loves you wrong
Breaking the heart you should be ruling
Doing the man who loves you wrong
I go for a lot of things, but you're a little too strong

Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end
Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end
You done leave me one time, baby, you'll leave again

[verse]

Everybody talk about it
Burning Hell
Ain't no heaven, I know
Ain't no Burning Hell

Can't nobody tell

I am going, Deacon Jones
I went down to the church house
I got down on my bended knee
I prayed, I prayed all night, I prayed
Deacon Jones, pray for me

I went down to the church house
I got down on my knee
I begged, Deacon Jones to pray for me
He said, son, here my hand

Ain't no heaven
Ain't no Burning Hell

Ain't no heaven, Ain't no heaven, no Burning Hell
When I die, where I go, nobody know

No Burning Hell
Ain't no burning, no Burning Hell
When I die, in my grave, nobody know where I'm going
Ain't no heaven, ain't no hell
When I die, nobody tell

Hey hey, Hey hey
Deacon Jones, pray for me

I don't believe, I don't believe in no heaven
I don't believe in no hell
When I die, where I go, nobody know
