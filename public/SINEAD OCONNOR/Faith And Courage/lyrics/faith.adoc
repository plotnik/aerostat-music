== The Healing Room

[verse]
____  
I have a universe inside me
Where I can go, an spirit guides me
There I can ask oh any question
I get the answers if I listen

I have a healing room inside me
The loving healers there they feed me
They make me happy with their laughter
They kiss and tell me I'm their daughter
I'm their daughter

(Me love you lots of lots of lots)

You have a little voice inside you
It doesn't matter who you think you may be
You're not free if you don't know me

See I'm not the lie that lives outside you
And it doesn't matter what you think you believe
You're not free if you don't know me
If you don't know me

See I am the universe inside you
You come to me and I will guide you
And make you happy with my laughter
I joy in seeing you're my daughter
You're my daughter
So believe you're not free if you don't know me
if you don't know me
if you don't know me
if you don't know me
if you don't know me
if you don't know me
if you don't know

== No Man's Woman

[verse]
____  
I don't wanna be no man's woman
It don't make me happy this mantrolling
thing that you got for me so I become
no man's woman

I don't wanna be no man's woman
I've other work I want to get done
I haven't travelled this far to become
no man's woman
no man's woman

Cuz I'm tired of it
and I'm so scared of it
that I'll never trust again
cuz a man can fake you
take your soul and make you
miserable in so much pain

My friends think I'm alone but I've got secrets
I don't tell everything about the love I get
I got a lovin' man but he's a spirit

He never does me harm never treats me bad
He'd never takes away all the love he has
and I'm forgiven oh a million times

I'm never tired of it
and I'm not scared of it
cuz it doesn't cause me pain
Like a man can fake you
take your soul and make you
never be yourself again

I never wanna be no man's woman
I only wanna be my own woman
I haven't travelled this far to become
no man's woman
no man's woman
no man's woman

== Jealous

[verse]
____  
You're jealous
You just can't stand to see me get along without you
Like I do, you told me to

Now you're jealous
You don't know how hard it was to be alone without you
And wanting you, like I do

I would've stayed if you'd wanted
would have been willing
But you said I treat you so badly
I can't be forgiven
You know I would have done anything
To make it through with you
But I don't deserve to be lonely
Just cuz you say I do

You're jealous
You don't know how hard it is to be a woman in love with you
When you're so cruel, and so jealous
You don't think about anybody's feelings but your own.
Are you coming home?

I would've stayed if you'd wanted
Would have been willing
But you said I treat you so badly
I can't be forgiven
You know I would have done anything to make it through with you
But I don't deserve to be lonely just cuz you say I do

So if you're gonna go you've got a go and if you're staying stay
Cuz I can't take the pain you keep leaving when you go away
If you're gonna go you've got a go and if you're staying stay
Cuz I can't take the pain you keep leaving when you go away

I don't deserve to be so lonely
I don't deserve to cry
I don't deserve to be so lonely

== Dancing Lessons

[verse]
____  
I wanna go walking with you
If you'd agree
I wanna do some talking with you
Where no one can see
I wanna go dancing darling
If you'd agree
I think I'll feel a safe step darling
If you were with me

And when you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you've found me
You take my rainy days and make 'em go away

Long time I've been thinking of you
Do you think of me too?
Long time I've been dreaming of you
make this dream come true
Long time I've been wondering 'bout this
Can this really exist?
I think I feel a peaceful feeling
In the warmth in your kiss

And when you wrap your arms around me
And when you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you've found me
You take my rainy days and make them go away

And on this journey may the good Lord guide us
And may the goddess dance beside us
When you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you've found me
You take my rainy days and make 'em go away

When you wrap your arms around me
When you take me close and say
That you're so happy and so glad you've found me
You take my rainy days and make them go away

== Daddy I'm Fine

[verse]
____  
I was born in Dublin town
Where there was not too much going down
For girls whose only hope
Was not to find a man who could piss in a pot
So early I heard my first guitar
And I knew I wanted to be a big star
And I told my poor worried father
Said I ain't gonna go to school no more
Cuz see I wanna look cool and I wanna look good
My hair slicked back and my black leather boots
Wanna stand up tall with my boobs upright
And feel real hot when my makeup's nice
I get sexy underneath the lights
Like I wanna fuck every man in sight
Baby come home with me tonight
Make you feel good make you feel all right

I'm going away to London
I got myself a big fat plan
I'm gonna be a singer in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm gonna change everything I can

Sorry to be disappointing
Wasn't born for no marrying
Wanna make my own living singing
Strong independent pagan woman singing

And I feel real cool and I feel real good
Got my hair shaved off and my black thigh boots
I stand up tall with my pride upright
And feel real hot when my makeup's nice
I get sexy underneath them lights
Like I wanna fuck every man in sight
Baby come home with me tonight
Make you feel good make you feel all right

I'm glad I came here to London
I've had myself some big fat fun
And I have even made some mon'
I've got the most angelic son
My baby daughter is golden
And I do what I like for fun
And I am happy in my prime

Daddy I'm fine, Daddy I'm fine, Daddy I'm fine,
Daddy I'm fine, And daddy I...love...you

== 'Til I Whisper U Something

[verse]
____  
Sure hate to see u looking so sad
Delicate man it needn't be that bad
U sit with me and I will listen
You'll feel much better when u open

U said all u wanted was a good time
Like a big hill u have to climb
And u got to be willing

U stand tall and u be strong
U have ruthless compassion
For yourself and for everyone
Yeah it's hard but it can be done

I know you've every right to feel grief
You've not had anything that u need
But u put your head on my shoulder
'Til I whisper u something
'Til I whisper u something

It don't take much to have a good time
A lot of lovemaking and a little wind
And u got to be willing

U stand tall and u stand strong
U try ruthless compassion
For yourself and for everyone
Yeah it's hard but it can be done

But U put your head on my shoulder
'Til I whisper u something
'Til I whisper u something

It's a long walk towards a good time
It's a big hill u have to climb
And u got to be willing

It don't take much to have a good time
A lot of lovemaking and a little wind
And u got to be willing

If you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
How would u recognise one
How would u recognise one, how would u
How would u even find one
How would u, if you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
How would you recognise one

== Hold Back the Night

[verse]
____  
I want to walk
Into the light
Day has turned cold
Hold back the night
What will become
Of you and I
We had a dream
Don't let it die
Just hold back the night

Do you wanna be, wanna be
My dying day
My darkest hour
My overdose
Cuz that's what you'll be
Just hold back the night

There was a time
I know you'll agree
We saw it all
A glorious sight
Everyone's burned
Everything's gone
What we were then
Now we are not
So hold back the night

Do you wanna be, wanna be
My dying day
My darkest hour
My overdose
Cuz that's what you'll be
Just hold back the night

Cuz that's what you'll be
Just hold back the night

== What Doesn't Belong to Me

[verse]
____  
The woman named Iris gave birth to the goddess
In her son who can't say her name
Because of all the pain
I miss you but I'm glad you're gone
I want you but I'm not alone
I'm haunted by you
But I'll get you gone if it takes me all my life long
You take back the pain you gave me
You take back what doesn't belong to me
Take back the shame you gave me
Take back what doesn't belong to me

I'm Irish, I'm English, I'm Moslem, I'm Jewish,
I'm a girl, I'm a boy
And the goddess meant for me only joy
And real love requires you, give up those loves
Whom you think you love best
Love puts you through the test
And only loyal love will bring me happiness

And take back the rage you gave me
Take back the hatred you gave me for me
Take back the anger that nearly killed me
Take back what doesn't belong to me

And real love requires you
Give up those loves
That you think you love best
Love put you through the test
And only loyal love will bring you happiness

And take back the pain you gave me
You take back what doesn't belong to me
Take back the blame you gave me
Take back what doesn't belong to me
Take back what doesn't belong to me
Take back what doesn't belong to me
Take back what doesn't belong to me

== The State I'm In

[verse]
____  
I'm circling around the sun
Hoping for a chance to see
You above everyone
To rescue me from this heat
I'm waiting for night to fall
And it's been days
Are you sorry yet
You took our one and final breath
When the flag was halfway down
Just look at me now...

Oooooh - It's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin
Oooooh - Won't you help me out of the state I'm in
Oooooh - I can't stand myself since you've been gone
There's nothing there to lean upon

Walk into a photograph
That waiter took so well
Oooh if I could only laugh
Like that girl at some hotel
I call out to anyone
But not too loud
I'm not ready yet
To share the phone or TV set
It's a long long way to come
Out of this one ...

Oooooh - It's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin
Oooooh - Won't you help me out of the state I'm in
Oooooh - I can't stand myself since you've been gone
There's nothing there to lean upon

And now it seems so fatal
The last stone we left uncradled
And I ask you are you sorry yet
Are you sorry yet
Cuz I may never come
Out of this one ...

Oooooh - It's like a breeze blowing deep beneath my skin
Oooooh - Won't you help me out of the state I'm in
Oooooh - I can't stand myself since you've been gone
There's nothing there to lean upon

Oooooh - It's blowing deep, blowing deep
Oooooh - help me out, help me out of that state I'm in
Oooooh - It's blowing deep beneath my skin

This is the state I'm in
This is the state I'm in

== The Lamb's Book of Life

[verse]
____  
Out of Ireland I have come
Great hatred and little room
Maimed us at the start
And now home just breaks my heart
To America I have come
I hope to bring your preachermen
Home to show my people how they can
Get their names back in the book of life of the lamb

I know that I have done many things
To give you reason not to listen to me
Esspecially as I have been so angry
But if you'd knew me maybe you would understand me
Words can't express how sorry I am
If I ever caused pain to anybody
I just hope that you can show compassion
And love me enough to just please listen

Out of Ireland I did run
Great hatred and little room
Aimed to break my heart
Or wreck me up and tear me all apart
To America I have come
I need to find a good preacherman
Who can show me how I can
Get my name back in the book of life of the lamb

I bring these blessings with me
A strong heart full of hope and a feeling
That everything in this world would be okay
If people just believed enough in God to pray
But the world thinks that sounds crazy
And that's the thing that makes me sing so sadly
To think that we would leave God so lonely
To think that we would mess up our own destiny

Out of history we have come
With great hatred and little room
It aimes to break our hearts
Or wrecks us up and tear us all apart
But if we listen to the preacherman
He can show us how it can be done
To live in peace and live as one
Get our names back in the book of life of the lamb

Out of hopelessness we can come
If people just believe it can be done
'cause every prayer ever prayed is heard
take power in the power of the word

Out of history we have come
With great hatred and little room
It aimes to break our hearts
Or wrecks us up and tear us all apart
But if we listen to the Rasta man
He can show us how it can be done
To live in peace and live as one
Get our names back in the book of life of the lamb

Out of history we have come
With great hatred and little room
It aimes to break our hearts
Or smash us up and tear us all apart
But if we listen to the Rasta woman
She can show us how it can be done
To live in peace and live as one
Get our names back in the book of life of the lamb

== If U Ever

[verse]
____  
The memories u bring
Make my eyes both sting
I can't help the pain that's tearing
At my throat and my chest
Where everything is kept
When I start remembering
How the clothes that u wore
Made my heart so sore
I just couldn't think anymore
Of u once u were gone
And it's been so long
I've been carrying on
And if u ever came home in the night
Darling I'll treat u right
Oh, darling I'll treat u right

U got into your car and u drove as far
As u could and even further
And no matter how I sang
I just never can
Stop needing your hand
Though I got into my own car and I drove as far
As I could so that I might forget u
I never could, does that mean I'm no good
If it doesn't it should

But if you ever came home in the night
Darling I'd treat u right
Oh darling I'd treat u right

If you ever came home in the night
Darling I'd treat u right
And darling I'd treat u right

== Emma's Song

[verse]
____  
The first time I saw you
I loved you
I loved you
Your face blue
Your eyes too
Your mouth too
Your mouth too

When I heart you
I wanted to
Give birth to you
Give birth to you
I made love to you
I made love to you
The great goddess
Had us blessed

The last time I saw you
I fought with you
I fought with you
I didn't mean to
I didn't mean to
Oh say you'll see me
Let me say sorry

The next time I'll see you
I'll love you
I'll be sweet to you
I'll take you to
My healing room
Oh we both know
How loneliness goes

Everytime I see you
I want you
I want you
The more I do
You hate me to
But the great goddess
Had us blessed
