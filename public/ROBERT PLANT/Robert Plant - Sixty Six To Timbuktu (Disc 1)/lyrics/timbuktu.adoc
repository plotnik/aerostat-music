== Big Log

[verse]
____
My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the taillights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight

My love is the miles and the waiting
The eyes that just stare, and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns, and the pain that won't stop
And its fuel is the years
Leading me on - leading me down the road
Driving beyond - driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side
Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back - no
There is no turning back - on the run

My love is in league with the freeway
Oh the freeway, and the coming of night-time
My love
My love is in league with the freeway

== Calling to You

[verse]
____
Beyond the river - over the sea
Somewhere's last last farewell that ever will be
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you

Out in the blue now, just waiting to be
A little breath of selflessness, adrift in all the greed
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you

Look for the match - cover Adam and Eve
All the world when new was fire - it still was the scene
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you

So you're gonna - it's for your honour - it's gonna be done

Where you gonna go? when you gonna stop?
Who stole the keys to the gates of the castle of love?
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you

Who you gonna call? what you gonna say?
Standin' in the shadows as the world's just fadin' away
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you

Who you gonna call? when you gonna stop?
Who stole the keys to the gates of the castle of love?
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you
It's calling to you, calling to you, calling to you

Who you gonna call? what you gonna say?
Standin' in the shadows as the world's just fadin' away
Just fadin' away, just fadin' away --

== Darkness, Darkness

[verse]
____
Darkness, Darkness, be my pillow, 
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow, 
In the silence of your deep

Darkness, darkness, hide my yearning, 
For the things I cannot see
Keep my mind from constant turning, 
To the things I cannot be

Darkness, darkness, be my blanket, 
Cover me with the endless night
Take away the pain of knowing, 
Fill the emptiness with light
Emptiness with light now

Darkness, darkness, long and lonesome, 
Is the day that brings me here
I have felt the edge of sadness, 
I have known the depths of fear

Darkness, darkness, be my blanket, 
Cover me with the endless night
Take away this pain of knowing, 
Fill this emptiness with light now
Emptiness with light now

Darkness, darkness, be my blanket, 
Cover me with the endless night
Take away this pain of knowing, 
Fill this emptiness with light now
Oh with light now.

Darkness, Darkness, be my pillow, 
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow, 
In the silence of your deep
In the silence of your deep
In the - oh oh yeah
In the summer baby
come on come on come on baby...

== Dirt in a Hole

[verse]
____
The preacher bowed and turned to go
He threw some dirt into a hole
He wasn't needed anymore
He shrugged and cast away the cold
He rearranged his preachers clothes
The word of god is all he knows

Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

Message from heaven
Sun in the sky
Message from heaven
News from on high

God bless the solder and his gun
Small sacrifice then justice done
He's every broken mothers son
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

Message from heaven
Sun in the sky
Message from heaven
News from on High
Message from heaven
Sun in the sky
Message from heaven

Message from heaven
Message from heaven
Message from heaven

He threw some words into the air
He spoke the pain we all must share
How we will meet again out there

Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array
Picked to die and fade away

Precious boy so young and fair
Guarding castles in the air
Pretty flowers in sweet array,
Picked to die and fade away

== For What It's Worth

[verse]
____
There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking' their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly saying, "hooray for our side"

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

We better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

We better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down? 
____


== Heaven Knows

[verse]
____
A brand new human being, razor sharp, all firm and tanned
All clean, all pure, with a thirty-second attention span
As the clock strikes twelve and we're ready for party games
You play blind man's buff and I'll play out charades

(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) why you take an eye for an eye
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
You were pumping iron as I was pumping irony

Now I find myself fully occupied and half alive
With your head, heart, arms and legs wrapped around my family pride
See the whites of their eyes then shoot
With all the romance of the Ton Ton Macoute

(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I [etc repeated]

Nothing will show as we're shedding our clothes
But then I suppose, anything goes, anything goes
But then I suppose that anything, anything goes
(Heaven knows - heaven knows --)

(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
Tell me please, please, please
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I --

== I Believe

[verse]
____
Tears, tears at the water's edge
Hey little sister, there is laughter instead
Tears for the teacher, from the eyes, from the soul
This restless spirit takes a long way back home
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper - I hear you, so talk to me

Oh, I believe, eye to eye
Say brother, sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story I'm told

I believe, eye to eye
Say brothers, sister, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's so much glory from the story untold

Big fire, on top of the hill
A hopeless gesture, and last farewell
Tears from your mother, from the pits of her soul
Look at your father, see his blood run cold
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper - I hear you, so talk to me

I believe, eye to eye
Say brothers, sister, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
With so much glory from the story untold

I believe, eye to eye
Say brother, sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's so much glory from the story untold

== If I Were a Carpenter

[verse]
____
If I were a carpenter, and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?
If a tinker were my trade, would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made - following behind me?
Save my love through loneliness - save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness - give me your tomorrow

If I worked my hands in wood, would you still love me?
Answer me, babe: "yes I would - I'd put you above me"
If a miller were my trade, at a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your colour box - your soft shoes shining
Save my love through loneliness - save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness - come give me your tomorrow

If I were a carpenter, and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?

== If It's Really Got to Be This Way

[verse]
____
If it's really got to be this way
I can take it, I don't know
I'll just carry on day to day
Till I make it on my own

Oh, I'll cry, I'll get by
I'll forgive you girl by and by
And I'll forget you some day
If it's really got to be this way

If this is what you think you need
Go ahead girl and do it
Doesn't make a lot of sense to me
But if it's what you want I'll live through it

Oh, I'll cry, I'll get by
I'll forgive you girl by and by
And I'll forget you some day
If it's really got to be this way

In my heart
There will always be a place for you
In my heart
I will always believe we could have made it you and me

Oh, I'll cry and I'll get by
And I'll forgive you girl by and by
And I'll forget you some day

Yes, I'll forget you some day
If it's really got to be this way

If it's really got to be this way
If it's really got to be this way
If it's really got to be this way
I can make it I can make it

The land and the sky fall quite
Silence moves over the land

Her song echoes a calling
For life to begin again

Her song echoes a calling
For life to begin again
For life to begin again

Little by little, my heart green
Little by little, I call your name
Little by little, my tears fall
Little by little, everything changes

Little by little, the time goes
Little by little, the days pass by

Little by little, I can breathe again
I can breathe again --

Back at the mirror - your good friend
Talk to the mirror, but play out your game
Sat in the middle, I stop then
Look at the winner, and the price you pay

Close the window - I tremble
Love was a fall that had no end
Now little by little - the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe again
I can breathe again --

I call your name - I call your name
I call your name - I call your name
Everything changes - everything changes
I call your name
I can breathe again --

Out in the street now, sick that you meet now
How many new friends do you call your own?

A nice place to play and no place to fall

With the rays of the morning sun
The morning breeze, it steer the trees
It sets one heart at ease
The birdie sings a melody, awakening the bees

Jamaica, Jamaica, land in the Carib Sea
Jamaica, oh Jamaica, land in the Carib Sea

Children in their uniforms on their way to school
Adults just walking happily on their way to work
To build a new Jamaica so we can live in peace

== Our Song

[verse]
____
Our song, we used to call it 'Our Song'
It helped us say hello once
It made us fall in love once
Without knowing
And how we tried so not to show it
Even though we didn't know it

Our song became just a little bit sadder
But it didn't seem to matter
Even when I kissed you
I couldn't please you, oh
And then all at once our love was gone
All you left me was our song

Every time I hear that song I could cry
Now you don't belong, no no no we've said our goodbye
I'm still wondering why
Oh yeah, those tears in my eyes, oh, oh

Our love started like a song, oh
But the melody went wrong
There's nothing left to do now
So I look around for someone new
Someone who is very, very, very lonely too
Then I won't sing our song, oh no no
____


== 29 Palms

[verse]
____
A fool in love - a crazy situation
Her velvet glove knocks me down and down and down
Her kiss of fire - a loaded invitation
Inside her smile she takes me down and down and down

Her moves look good - a touch of desparation
From where I stood she turned my head around, round and round

It comes kinda hard when I hear your voice on the radio
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you
29 Palms - I feel the heat of your desert heart
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you

Oh, I'm burning in love - a strange infatuation
White cold cold touch - what must I do, do, do
The heat and the dust increase my desolation
In God we trust - always for you, and you and you

It comes kinda hard [etc repeated]

Come on and stick with me, baby; we'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way

(Instrumental)

Everybody's been a-talkin'; yes, the news travels fast
They said the fire would stop burnin', that the flame wouldn't last
But I don't worry, honey; let them say what they may
Come on & stick with me, baby; we'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way

(Repeat & fade:)
Come on and stick with me, baby

That it would soon be over; that's not the way that I feel
But I don't worry, honey; let them say what they may

Oh baby - can't eat, can't sleep, can't understand a love song
Drive me crazy 'cause my feet won't quit as I go slidin' in the sweet zone
Round round like you want me to do
Down down like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep
I can kiss your mouth when I go to sleep

Oh, baby, got those personal moves so deep inside my move groove
I go crazy - my head won't quit as I crawl inside your love groove
Down down like you want me to do
Round round like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and it's much too steep
I can kiss your mouth when I go to sleep

I feel alright, 'cause my little girl wants to dance all night
What can I do - I know my little girl wants to dance with you

Oh darling, come on baby, come on and mess with me
Oh woman, I'll make it up to you, if you just drive me wild, child
Down down like you want me to do
Round round like you're daring me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep
I can kiss your mouth when I go to sleep

I feel alright, 'cause my little girl wants to dance all night
What can I do - I know my little girl wants to dance with you
I feel alright - my little girl wants to dance all night
What can I do - I know that girl wants to dance, dance, dance

I feel alright - my little girl she wants to dance all night
What can I do - my little girl wants to dance

[verse]
____
Can you feel my heart beat
Across a crowded room?
Oh, why don't you get close to me?
Gonna taste the cheap perfume

Can you feel my eyes on you?
Why don't you look my way?
I've come to not talk too late soon
Ain't gonna need to say

Red for danger, green for go
Dancing in the danger zone

Red for danger, green for go
All dressed up, nowhere to go
Look at me now

Through my open door
Wanna get you running scared
And having to take you by force

Am I coming on strong with you?
Can you see through my disguise?
You know what I wanna do, babe
Take a look through my eyes

== Road to the Sun

[verse]
____
Lost my way on the outskirts
Adrift on the road to the sun
Caught on emotional outbursts
This moment was waiting to come

Now misdirect to the gentians
And the guard at the side of the road
A page with a horn only madden
With the fear of being left in the cold, cold, cold

One mild headache and we're waiting
With all the hope that's to come
Left by the 'skirts with my gun
With the sand in the glass waits for love

Bright as the light that is shining
Strong as a will heaven sent
Through the arms I've been waiting
White as he smiles at his men, oh

I don't want, I don't need to I know
I don't want, I don't need to

And I ask for you city
These pillars of marble and stone
Friendship and love never last
We wipe our hands on the ground

Long have I dreamed of this windmill
A dream that all mine to behold
Far I've come since that first glass
Like a landmine returns to the fold, fold, fold

Naugh
I don't want, I don't need to I know
I don't want, I don't need it

Oh yeah
My my baby
Ahh, yeah
You're so
Oh
Ah, ahh
Ahh, yeah
Oh

But it's too late, but it's too late,
But it's too late baby
Lost my way, don't know where to go
Lost my way, don't know where to go
Lost my way, don't know where to go
Don't know where to go, don't know where to go...

== Rude World

[verse]
____
You must be proud of yourself
Taking a stand against the world
Ruled by man
With your fist in the air
Metaphorically you take on the world
Girl you're like Muhammed Ali
I'm sorry about that
People they're moving around
They're driftin' and driftin'
Around this town
Forgetting their friends
Forgetting their names
Overlook me now, but you can't skip James
I'm sorry 'bout that
I don't mean this to be a shock
I'm telling you honey
'Cause you know it rocks
A smiling sniper taking aim
It gives him pleasure
To give Pain
In a rude world
It's a rude world
I'm sorry about that
Rude world babe

Oh, that's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you

Come with me to the sea of love
Come with me, my love, to the sea
The sea of love
I wanna tell you just how much I love you
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you

== Ship of Fools

[verse]
____
On waves of love my heart is breaking
And stranger still my self control I can't rely on anymore
New tides surprise - my world it's changing
Within this frame an ocean swells - behind this smile I know it well

Beneath a lover's moon I'm waiting
I am the pilot of the storm - adrift in pleasure I may drown
I built this ship - it is my making
And furthermore my self control I can't rely on anymore
I know why - I know why
Crazy on a ship of fools
Crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around - back to my loving ground

Who claims that no man is an island
While I land up in jeopardy - more distant from you by degrees
I walk this shore in isolation
And at my feet eternity draws ever sweeter plans for me
I know why - I know why
Crazy on a ship of fools
Crazy on a ship of fools
Turn this boat around - back to my loving ground
Oh no, oh no - ship of fools --

== Song to the Siren

[verse]
____
Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you Hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
Touch me not, touch me not,
Oh, come back tomorrow;
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Shies from the sorrow

I am puzzled as a newborn baby
I am troubled as the tide
Should I stand amidst the breakers?
Or should I lie with Death my bride?
Swim to me
Swim to me
Oh, come let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you

== Tall Cool One

[verse]

I'm like a strange cat running in the heat of the night
I've got a fire in my eyes, got a date with delight
Some kinda moaning in in the heart of the storm
I'm gonna love you so hard, you'll want your loving done
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you

With my one hand loose I aim to satisfy
You like my loving machine - I like your bloodshot eye
Real gone girl, jumping back with the beat
I'll be your tall cool one with the crazy feet
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you --

I'm so tall and you're so cute
Let's play wild like wildcats do
You're gonna rock your tall cool one
I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that

You stroll, you jump, you're hot and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one and I'm built to please
You stroll, you jump, you're hot and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one and I'm built to please

(Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you --)

Move over mister - step on back in the crowd
'Cause she's a whole lotta sister 'bout to drive me wild
Lotta places I've been, lotta names, lotta words
No one compares to my real gone girl
Lighten up baby, I'm in love with you --

I'm so tall and you're so cute [etc repeated]

You stroll, you jump [etc repeated]

== Tie Dye on the Highway

[verse]
____
Tie dye on the highway - see the garlands in your hair
If you're going my way, come along
What a beautiful sky - we just had to stop and stare
See the beautiful colours fill the air

(Oh, just the messengers of peace)
Oh, do you remember - across the burning years
Sweet smell of the mystery I recall
Hang me on Miguel - a smile through all my fears
O high Olympus, touch our soul

With the messengers of peace and the company of love
All the passion and release, and love from up above
Say you will come back with me - say you will come back

Tie dye on the highway - the wheels still turn around
Dance to the mariachi - take my hand
Hope springs eternal when laughter's feeling sound
Move in the mystic wasted land

With the messenger of peace and the company of love
All the passion and release, and love from up above
(You know that it is true)
From the desert in my art, where the innocent may love
All the passions they release, and the love from up above
Say you will come back with me - say you will come back
Say you will come back with me - say you will come back

== Upside Down

[verse]
____
Cross my armored sword
And see what I can see
My king is at the kitchen
Sayin' the queen is on a leave

I am wishful lady
The reason is a whole
Far somewhere in the east fighting in the war

And the world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world has turned upside down

Burning our lives and ruining Mother Chant
Plays with that in mind, hanging from a cross
Oranges and lemons going for the sun
Fifty million elders facing desperately wrong

And the world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world has turned upside down

The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world has turned upside down

Upside down, inside up
Upside down, inside up, all the way round
Upside down, inside up
Upside down, inside up, all the way round

The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world has turned upside down

The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world has turned upside down

The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world's upside down
The world has turned upside down

Want my baby, gone somehow - ooh

Down the road I'm goin', down so far
Down the road I go, I go so far alone

Down the road and don't go cryin' - no

From my woman she's got another man
Saw my baby, she goin'
She gone some place but I don't know where

21 dreams I do
21 times I cried for you
Play it right

Look down the road and I
As far as I could see
Man got my woman,
But the blues got me
Oh this ain't no livin', no game alone

21 years that little girl left
21 times that she lied
