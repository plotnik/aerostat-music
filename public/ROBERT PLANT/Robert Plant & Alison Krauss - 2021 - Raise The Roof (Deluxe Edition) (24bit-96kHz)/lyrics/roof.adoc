== Quattro (World Drifts In)

(originally by Calexico)

[verse]
____
Love the run but not the race
All alone in a silent way
World drifts in and the world's a stranger

In a light, eclipsed and alienated
In a time, occupied and invaded
Can't tell what's right, better hit the ground running

In the hills where the tall weed grows
Hands are tied and won't let go
Can't escape this place without leaving the world behind

In a light, ashamed and humiliated
In a time, sacrificed for the sake of trade
The soul is bent, feels the weight of truth
Falling through
Left behind, no choice but to run to the mountains
Where no poppies grow, you have to hit the ground running

In a light, paralyzed and spirits fading
Out of time, must decide to fall or run
Into the eye, of the storm no sign or omen
Make it right, or fall to the other side
Where fields are burning
You'll always hit the ground running
Running
Running 
____

== The Price of Love

(originally by The Everly Brothers)

[verse]
____
Wine is sweet and gin is bitter
Drink while you can but you won't forget her

You talk too much, you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd

That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame

Kiss one girl, kiss another
Kiss 'em all but you won't recover

You're dancin' slow, you're dancin' fast
You're happy now but that won't last

That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame

That's the price of love, the price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame

Wine is sweet and gin is bitter
Drink while you can but you won't forget her

You won't forget her 
____

== Go Your Way

(originally by Anne Briggs)

[verse]
____
Drawing water from the well
Spilling over on the grass
Walking home, my heart is filled with pain
Woe is me

Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love

As I wander through the trees
Picking off the windy leaves
Thinking where you may be sleeping now
I wanna die

Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love

As I sit mending your clothes
That you will never ever wear
Cooking daily for you, I do prepare
But woe is me

Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love

Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love

Is there war in some far land?
And have you gone to lend your hand?
And do you lie, broken and dying now?
I wanna die

Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love

Drawing water from the well
Spilling over on the grass
Walking home, my heart is filled with pain
Woe is me

Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love
Go your way, my love 
____

== Trouble with My Lover

(originally by Betty Harris)

[verse]
____
Sometimes I get lonesome
Sometimes I get a little blue
He's got me walking around in circles
And I don't know what to do

What good is love
You can't have it when you want it
What good is love if you
If you can't own it

Love can be so good
And love can be so cruel
Love can make you happy
Love can make you blow your cool

But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the middle of the dark
You know he fills me up with a kind of delight
Ooh the mans all right

(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble

I feel so helpless
I can't help myself
I don't want to see him, oh no
With nobody else

In the restless hours
I sit home alone
I wish I could meet him oh
This man I love

But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the middle of the dark
You know he fills me up with a kind of delight
Ooh the mans all right

(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in trouble
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble
(Trouble with my lover)
Mmm
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble 
____

== Can't Let Go

(originally by Lucinda Williams)

[verse]
____
Told you, baby, one more time
Don't make me sit all alone and cry
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

I'm like a fish out of water, a cat in a tree
You don't even want to talk to me
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

See I got a candle and it burns so bright
In my window every night
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

You don't like to see me standing around
Feel like I been shot and didn't fall down
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

Turn off the trouble like you turn off a light
Went off and left me, it just ain't right
Well, it's over I know it but I can't let go

Around every corner, something I see
Brings me right back how it used to be
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

It's over, I know it but I can't let go
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
It's over, I know it but I can't let go

== It Don’t Bother Me

(originally by Bert Jansch)

[verse]
____
To be exposed in all my strife
You gaze upon my troubled life
But it don't bother me
What you see

You take my name and hang it high
You paint my picture with colored lies
But it don't bother me
What you do

You twist my words like plaited reeds
To mark your gain and help your needs
But it don't bother me
What you say

What truth is told of who I am
Shall break the silence of waters calm
But it don't bother me
Who I am

But if you were a beggar boy
You'd sing of riches you could enjoy
But it, it don't bother me
What they are

I'm a thinkin' now, I'd rather hide
Or turn my back or stand aside
But it, it don't bother me
What I do

'Cause it don't bother me 
____

== You Led Me to The Wrong

(originally by Ola Belle Reed)

[verse]
____
Oh me
Oh my
You led me to the wrong

Some people born with silver and gold
Others have husbands and wives
I never had a thing in this whole wide wicked world
And now, I'm losing my life
And now, I'm losing my life

You promised me that we would be wed
On this I'd laid my money down
You were seen courtin' my best friend
You caused me to shoot him down
You caused me to shoot him down

The love of a woman is bitter, but it's sweet
Even though she turns him down
The price I have to pay may come to you some day
And you'll in the sea of sorrow drown
And you'll in the sea of sorrow drown

Well, they say I have a right to my very last few words
Before they let the scaffold down
A man has to fight for what he thinks is right
Even if it puts him in the ground
Even if it puts him in the ground

Oh me
Oh my
You led me to the wrong 
____

== Last Kind Words Blues

(originally by Geeshie Wiley)

[verse]
____
The last kind words I heard my daddy say
Lord, the last kind words I heard my daddy say

If I die, if I die in the German war
I want you to send my body, send it to my mother, Lord

If I get killed, if I get killed, please don't bury my soul
I prefer you leave me out, let the buzzards eat me whole

When you see me comin', look 'cross the rich man's field
If I don't bring you flour, I'll bring you bolted meal

I went to the depot, I looked up at the sun
Cried some train don't come, there'll be some walkin' done

My mama told me, just before she died
Lord, precious daughter, don't you be so wild

The Mississippi river, you know it's deep and wide
I can stand right here, see my babe from the other side

What you do to me baby, never gets outta me
I may not see you after I cross the deep blue sea
____

== High and Lonesome

[verse]
____
Take me down, down to the river
Lift me high, up on the flood
And there will be no turning back
And I must find my love
I must find my love
I must find my love

Well, now, meet me in the bottom
With the serpents and the vine
And I must shout out loud
Will she still be mine?
Will she still be mine?
Will she still be mine?

I shall not rest upon the highway
I will not tire nor despair
I shall conspire, I will be there
I'll make a deal, I'll dance in hell
I'll sing out loud and louder yell
I will open every, every door, yeah

Unconversated, out in the wild words
With the lion and the dove
And if I should lose my mind
There, I must find my love
There, I must find my love
There, I must find my love

Leave me high, high on the mountain
With the naked and the free
And if I should bare my soul
Would she still care for me?
Would she still care for me?
Would she still care for me?
Would she still care for me?

I shall not rest upon the highway
I will not tire nor despair (I will not tire nor despair)
I shall conspire, I will be there
I'll make a deal, I'll dance in hell
I'll sing out loud and louder yell (I'll sing out loud and yell)
I will open every door, oh

I'm lost out on the ocean
I will calm the seven seas
So all alone, so high and lonesome
Does she still think of me?
Does she still think of me?
Does she still think of me?

== Going Where the Lonely Go

(originally by Merle Haggard)

[verse]
____
Rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go

Making up things to do
Not running in all directions trying to find you
I'm just rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go

I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

I've got to keep going
Traveling down this lonesome road
I'll be rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go

I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
'Cause sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

I've got to keep going
Traveling down this lonesome road
I'll be rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go 
____

== Somebody Was Watching Over Me

(originally by Pops Staples)

[verse]
____
I've been shot up and shook down
I've been turned away and turned around
Nobody to call my own
In this mean, old world alone
Many many months I cried
Somebody was on my side
Down in my soul I knew
Someway that I'd get through

Looking back, now I see
Somebody was watching over me

Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching

Well, I've been locked up and locked down
I've been used and abused
Didn't know if I was uptown or downtown
You know my life was so confused
Living in a state of depression
Something save me from my obsession
My strength was put to the test
My weakness put to rest
Looking back, now I see
Somebody was watching over

Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching over me
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching over me
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Now my bad times is better than the
Good times used to be
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching

Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching

There was a time when
Peace, I could not find
Nothing to call my own
No job, no car, no home
Staying in a one room shack
All I had was the clothes on my back
Each day my only plan
Had a bottle in my hand

Looking back, now I see
Somebody was watching over me

Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching over me
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching over me
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Now my bad times is better than the
Good times used to be
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching

Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching
Somebody was watching

== My Heart Would Know

(originally by Hank Williams with His Drifting Cowboys)

[verse]
____
I could say it's over now
That I was glad to see you go
I could hate you for the way I'm feeling
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know

It's a sin to make me cry
When you know I love you so
I could tell my heart that I don't miss you
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know

I could give you all the blame
But I'm sure the truth would show
I could tell this world I've found a new love
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know

I can't fool my crying heart
'Cause it knows I need you so
I could tell my heart I'm glad we parted
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know 
____

== You Can’t Rule Me

(originally by Lucinda Williams)

[verse]
____
You know I've got a right
To talk about what I see
The way too much is going wrong
Right in front of me

You can't rule me
You can't rule me
You can't take my money and try to rule me too

You might expect for me to follow
But I ain't gonna fall in line
I tell you what, this much I know
The dotted line a-ain't been signed

You can't rule me
You can't rule me
You can't take my soul and try to rule me too

Oh, take it on!

You might beat me, you might cheat me
And try to make me change my mind
You might stick me, you might trick me
I'm gonna tell you one last time

You can't rule me
You can't rule me
You can't take my money and try to rule me too

You wanna go ahead and tell me what's good for me
You wanna tell me what I'm paying for
The game is fixed and it's plain to see
I ain't playing you no more

You can't rule me
You can't rule me
You can't take my soul and try to rule me too

Yeah, man, I've got a right
To talk about what I see
The way too much is going wrong
Right in front of me

You can't rule me
You can't rule me
You can't take my money and try to rule me too

Let's go!
