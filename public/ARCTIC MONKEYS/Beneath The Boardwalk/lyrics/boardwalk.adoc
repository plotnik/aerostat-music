== A Certain Romance

[verse]
____
Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point is that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all OK to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
'Cause their minds are made up
And course is all OK to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no!
Well oh, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go, oh no, no?

But over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known them for a long long time
And yet they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
No not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no!

== Bigger Boys And Stolen Sweethearts

[verse]
____
There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he’s fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

Now you don't know what she's up to you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that’s what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She’s looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's so clear you were though

Have you heard what she has been doing? Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She’s been with all of the boys but, never went very far
And she wagged English and science just to go in his car

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
Oh now the girls have grown
Yeah but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I'm only pretending, you know
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know

Hoping they're looking for you

For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Why don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

...the lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

But don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Why don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for but no

Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
Sorry love I'll have to turn you down

And oh he must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around

And look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous
And he don't have to say 'owt
She understands she's here to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and...
