== I Can't Stop Now

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+I+Can't+Stop+Now

[verse]
____
Every time I'm away I think about you
I wish that you were near me
Gets so bad at times I talk to myself
I wish that you could hear me.
I get to thinking how it all started out, and I know, oh I know
It may not last forever
But in the meantime when the goin' is good, I know, oh I know
That we should be together.
You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.
When I come home I know I don't ever have much to say
I'm just glad to be there
You ask about the people I've met and the places I've been
You ask me what I see there.
I see you, I see you everywhere I go
I see you all around me
On a ship, on a train, on a plane, no matter where I am
I feel your love surround me.
You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.
You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.

[verse]
____
Shoeshine boy, he's makin' his money workin' dowtown on Main Street
Shoeshine boy, I know it ain't funny cleanin' everything on two feet
Get down, get down upon your knees and brush your blues away
It won't be long 'til Saturday night and you'll be dancin' with your lady 'til the break of day.
Shoeshine boy, don't have no ambition, just wants to be a kerbside boot black
Shoeshine boy, your daddy's getting older, gotta take the weight off his back
Get down, get down upon your knees and brush your blues away
It won't be long 'til Saturday night and you'll be dancin' with your lady 'til the break of day.
You know you feel so good when she comes to need you
And when you're dancin' together, you just can't beat you.
Get down, get down upon your knees and brush your blues away
It won't be long 'til Saturday night and you'll be dancin' with your lady 'til the break of day.
You know you feel so good when she comes to need you
And when you're dancin' together, you just can't beat you.

[verse]
____
Oh come drink my wine and make part of the things that I planned for you
Come drink my wine and sit down here beside me today
I want you to know me and tell me the things that are on your mind
I want you to come to the knowledge that you can stay
I'll be watching you for such a long time
I'll know every move you make
I'll sit at my window not knowing what I can do
If I wait much longer I'll bound al to lose the desert stage
Oh would you plaese do as I ask come drink my wine
In the warm enchanting glow of the wine we'll find pleasure
I'm sure your troubles will vanish as will mine
I'll know that our meeting is one that for ever I'll treasure
Oh would you please do as I ask come drink my wine

Oh come drink my wine and be part of the things that I'll p[lanned for you
Come drink my wine and sit down here beside me today
I want you to know me and tell me the things that are on your mind
I want you to come to the knowing that you can stay.

== Her Father Didn't Like Me Anyway

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+I+Can't+Stop+Now

[verse]
____
The coat she wore still lies upon the bed The book I gave her that she never read She left without a single word to say
Her father didn't like me anyway.

She always wanted more than I could give She wasn't happy with the way we lived
I didn't feel like asking her to stay
Her father didn't like me anyway.

Daddy never knew just what she'd seen in me
Daddy didn't like my hair
Perhaps if we had talked, he'd have seen something in me
But Daddy didn't really care.

To tell the truth I didn't have the nerve
I know I only got what I deserved
So now she's taken leave of me today
Her father didn't like me anyway.

Daddy never knew just what she'd seen in me
Daddy didn't like my hair
Perhaps if we had talked, he'd have seen something in me
But Daddy didn't really care.
The coat she wore still lies upon the bed The book I gave her that she never read She left without a single word to say
Her father didn't like me anyway.

[verse]
____
I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of blue
I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of blue
I don't know what I'm doin', Can't keep my mind off you.

I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of green
I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of green
I don't know where I'm goin', don't know where I've been.

I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of grey
I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of grey
It doesn't matter what I try, these feelings wont go away.

I'm cruisin', I'm on a river of black
I'm cruisin', I'm on a river so black
The only thing I'm sure of, don't think I'll ever be back.

== Everybody Knows That

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+Everybody+Knows+That

[verse]
____
It only rains when clouds bang together,
But everybody knows that.
And its rockets and missiles that are causing this bad weather,
But everybody knows that.
But does anybody know
The way that things are gonna go for them tomorrow?
What will they do when they turn round 
and find that they have no time left to borrow?

Ms. Zsa Zsa Gabor is the world's greatest actress, 
But everybody knows that.
And the sex bomb of the 50s got her first break on a mattress, 
But everybody knows that. 
But does anybody know 
The way that things are gonna go for them tomorrow? 
What will they do when they turn round 
and find that they have no time left to borrow? 
A ring with a pearl is bound to bring you tears,
But everybody knows that, 
And if you break a mirror it's bad luck for seven years,
But everybody knows that. 
But does anybody know 
The way that things are gonna go for them tomorrow? 
What will they do when they turn round 
and find that they have no time left to borrow?

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+Now+I+Feel+So+Old

[verse]
____
You blew in with the spring time and you took me by surprise
I saw things i never dreamed of as I gazed into your eyes
You said that you would stay until the leaves had turned to gold
I was so young and happy then but now I feel so old

I think of you at night time as I'm lying on my own
You've no idea how much I miss the things I've hardly known
When you were here the winters didn't seem to be as cold
But i felt so young and happy then and now i feel so old

Are you happy since you been away where are you living now
I ask these questions constantly since you left until now
It's funny when you think on how I used to be so bold
But I felt so young and happy then and now I feel so old

[verse]
____
Well I married a wife in the month of June,
Married her up by the light of the moon.
We live down on Cripple Creek.
We've been there about a week.

[Chorus]
I'm a-goin' down to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.
Goin' down to Cripple Creek to have some fun.
Goin' down to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.
Goin' down to Cripple Creek to have some fun.

Now Cripple Creek girl's about half-grown,
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone.
Roll my pants up to my knees,
Cross on Cripple Creek a-when I please.

[Chorus]

Well I'm goin' to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run.
I'm a-goin' to Cripple Creek to have some fun.

[Chorus]

I'm a-goin' to Cripple Creek, I'm goin' on a run,
Goin' to Cripple Creek to have some fun.

[verse]

Patrick my primitive painter of art
You will always and ever be near to my heart
I will never cross water, never cross sea
We will always be with you, Jock Connolly, and me.

The things that we have are all that we need
You have your painting, and I like to
Read books by people of feeling, someone sincere
They remind me of you and what we have here.

I will never cross water, never cross sea
We will always be with you, Jock Connolly, and me.

If in our lifetime we find peace of mind
We'll remember the bad days that we left behind
Thinking only of love and what it can bring
You paint songs for the children, a song we'll always sing.

You will always and ever be near to my heart
I will never cross water, never cross sea
We will always be with you, Jock Connolly, and me.

== Rick Rack

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+I+Can't+Stop+Now

[verse]
____
Rick rack, rickety rack
See the train go along the track
When I grow up I want to be an engine driver
But if I can't be that I'll be a deep sea diver.

My father says that I must always work on the land
And I never disagreed when I'd see him lift his hand
Mother thinks that I should be a carpenter to trade
That I could fill my house with the things that I had made.

Rick rack, rickety rack
See the train go along the track
When I grow up I want to be an engine driver
But if I can't be that I'll be a deep sea diver.

I look at the skies, see the birds that can fly, and I feel like cryin'

Like a bird on the tree I just want to free so I'll keep on tryin'.

Rick rack, rickety rack
See the train go along the track
When I grow up I want to be an engine driver
But if I can't be that I'll be a deep sea diver.

My brother says that I must pay attention at the school
Because I've never won a prize, he thinks that I'm a fool
Teacher always asks me why I look so far away
It's just that I find nothing in the words he has to say.

Rick rack, rickety rack
I'm leaving home and I'm never coming back
I'm on my way to be an engine driver
But if I can't be that I'll be a deep sea diver.

== Look Over The Hill And Far Away

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+I+Can't+Stop+Now

[verse]
____
Look over the hill and far away
We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

The figure stands at the windowpane
Up to the hill he looks again
Thinking back, he knows he was wrong
How could he leave his home for so long
And he's back to find no change of mind
Find more lyrics at ※ Mojim.com
He was blind, where can she be?

Why does he stand just outside the door
It does no good, he's stood there before
And just waved his hand, I don't understand
There's no one there, so who can explain?

Look over the hill and far away
We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

== Blood And Glory

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+I+Can't+Stop+Now

[verse]
____
Don't you feel like talkin' to a man who's fed up walkin' all the time
Don't you feel like sayin' to a man who's fed up prayin' that you're mine
We fought a lot of battles from Nebraska to Seattle, I'm so tired
We hid in lonely places and we never seen the faces 'til they fired.

Well hear me talkin' (blood and glory)
I'm fed up walkin' (blood and glory)
I'll tell a story (blood and glory)
About blood and glory.
Find more lyrics at ※ Mojim.com

When we threw away our sabers and we joined with Preston's Raiders for a while
We looted and we plundered while the Yankee cannons thundered, we just smiled
But now back home in Kentucky, and I know I've been lucky to survive
I never want to see another cannon aimed at me while I'm alive.

Well hear me talkin' (blood and glory)
I'm fed up walkin' (blood and glory)
I'll tell a story (blood and glory)
About blood and glory.

== Keep It To Yourself

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+Keep+It+To+Yourself

[verse]
____
I walk along the street and wonder what to do
I'd like to ease the pain in my troubled brain 
But as to how, I haven't a clue
Should I shout at the people who pass me by
Hey folks look at me, I'm no ordinary guy
I had a love and she swore she was mine
But she only loved me when the weather was fine.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

On a subway train, I hide from the rain
And take a seat right next to the door
There's a man with a case and as I look at his face
I'm sure I've seen him someplace before
He looks up and I look down
And then we both look away
The train slows down and my head spins ‘round
It's like scene from a one-act play.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

I feel much better when the sun has lost its glow
When the light of day is fading away
And there are shadows wherever I go
Yes the light is fading and I'm masquerading
As a poet with something to say
The inspiration's gone and I can't turn it on
It's been the same since she went away.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

[verse]

Walk in, sit down, open up your case
Tune up, and turn 'round to show your face to the crowd
Sing a song in a genuine bluegrass voice
About your big Dixie Darling, the banjo that's always in tune.

Please sing a song for us, play your guitar
There isn't one of us care who you are
But if the sound is good, you won't go wrong
Please sing a song for us and we will sing along (so long).

Stand up, stretch out to take the hand
Of a girl called Rosie who thought your performance was cool
Tune in, turn on, stop dead in your tracks
At a voice softly singing about some fool on a hill.

Please sing a song for us, play your guitar
There isn't one of us care who you are
And if the sound is good, you won't go wrong
Please sing a song for us and we will sing along (so long).

[verse]
____
I live under the coconut tree
I lie in the sun and I swim in the sea
I make my bed below the sky
I still watch the world just a passin' me by.

Hey hey, it's good to be free
'Cause they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.

I left home because of my nagging wife
Man oh man it was a terrible life
She took all my money and she left me with none
So I packed my bags and decided to run.

My wife and family are looking for me
But they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.

Hey hey, it's good to be free
'Cause they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.
I live under the coconut tree
I lie in the sun and I swim in the sea
I make my bed below the sky
I still watch the world just a passin' me by.

[verse]
____
Travel away, for a year and a day
Forget about time for goodbye
Do the things you'd like to do, say the things you'd like to say
And leave half your problems behind

You could sail on the oceans you've read about
You could fly in the sky above your head
You could walk through the forest of time sculptured trees
And run towards the greener grass ahead

Or would you rather hang around, your old familiar town
Just waiting for your turn to die
While the grass that grows beneath your feet, isn't even half as sweet
As the grass that lies beyond the sky

You could sail on the oceans you've read about
You could fly in the sky above your head
You could walk through the forest of time sculptured trees
And run towards the greener grass ahead

== Steamboat Row

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Rafferty+Connolly+lyrics+Steamboat+Row

[verse]
____
My daddy was a miner, said there was nothing finer
Than an Irish man who worked an honest day
From Steamboat Row, in rain or shine, he'd make his way down to the mine
Along the dusty road he'd travel
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine
He said he'd never go back down again
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could
Kept on walkin' down that road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

But when he took to drinkin' we knew that he was thinkin'
That his days were quickly coming to an end
He'd only speak of Steamboat Row, he said someday we ought to go
And walk along that dusty road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

Mr. McGonagle sits on the chimneytop wondering how he got there
A minute ago he was in his bed sleeping and now he's way up in the air
Who knows what the day will bring, it could bring anything
Who knows if we'll still be here, we could be there

Mrs. McDonagh was playing her banjo and singing a sweet lullaby
When all of a sudden there came a great crash, now she's flying way up in the sky
Who knows what the day will bring, it could bring anything
Who knows if we'll still be here, we could be there

Young Joseph Egan was cleaning his motorcar one Sunday morning in May
When out of the bonnet that there came a great giant and carried young Joseph away
Who knows what the day will bring, it could bring anything
Who knows if we'll still be here, we could be there
