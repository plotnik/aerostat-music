== Weather With You

[verse]
____
Walking 'round the room singing Stormy Weather
At Fifty Seven Mount Pleasant Street
Well it's the same room, but everything's different
You can fight the sleep, but not the dream

Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky

Well, there's a small boat made of china
It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece
Well, do I lie like a loungeroom lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released?

Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather, the weather with you

Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather, take the weather, the weather with you

Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather, take the weather, the weather with you

== World Where You Live

[verse]
____
Here's someone now who's got the muscle
His steady hand could move a mountain
Expert in bed, but come on now
There must be something missing
That golden one leads a double life
You'll find out

Tell me, I don't know where you go
Do you climb into space
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-hoo

So here we lie against each other
And these four walls can never hold us
We're looking for wide open spaces
High above the kitchen
And we're strangers here
On our way to some other place

But I don't know where you go
Do you climb into space
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-ho
To the world where you live

Friends come 'round
You might remember and be sad
Behind their eyes is unfamiliar

Do you climb into space
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-oh
To the world where you live, yeah, yeah
To the world where you live, hey, hey
To the world where you live
To the world where you live
To the world where you live 
____

== Fall At Your Feet

[verse]
____
I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
I think that I'm beginning to know her
Let it go
I'll be there when you call

And whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
The words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Know
I'll be waiting when you call

Hey, whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help?
Who knows where that might lead
I fall

Whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
Whenever I fall (at your feet)
Whenever I fall 
____

== Locked Out

[verse]
____
I've been locked out, I've been locked in
But I always seem to come back again
When you're in that room, oh what do you do?
I know that I will have you in the end

And the clouds they are crying on you
And the birds are offering up their tunes
In a shack as remote as a mansion
You escape into a place where nothing moves

And I've been locked out, and I know we're through
But I can't begin to face up to the truth
I wait so long for the walls to crack
But I know that I will one day have you back

And the hills are as soft as a pillow
And they cast a shadow on my bed
And the view when I look through my window
Is an altarpiece I'm praying to for the living and the dead

The twin valleys shines in the morning sun
I send a message out to my only one

Yet I've been locked out, and I know we're through
But I can't begin to face up to the truth
And I wait so long for the walls to crack
But I know that I will one day have you back,
Yes, I will

And I work, bees in the honey
Every night, I circle like the moon
And it's an act of simple devotion
But it can take forever when you've got something to prove

I've been locked out
And I've been locked out
And I've been locked out 
____


== Don't Dream It's Over

[verse]
____
There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know they won't win

Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now

Hey now, hey now

Hey now, hey now
Don't let them win

They come, they come
Don't let them win

Hey now, hey now (yeah)

Hey now, hey now 
____


== Into Temptation

[verse]
____
You opened up your door
I couldn't believe my luck
You in your new blue dress
Taking away my breath
The cradle is soft and warm
It couldn't do me no harm
You're showing me how to give

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into temptation
A muddle of nervous words

Could never amount to betrayal
The sentence is all my own
The price is to watch it fail
As I turn to go
You looked at me for half a second
With an open invitation
For me to go

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into temptation
Safe in the wide open arms of Hell

We can go sailing in
Climb down, lose yourself when you linger long
Into temptation
Right where you belong
The guilty get no sleep

In the last slow hours of morning
Experience is cheap
I should've listened to the warning
But the cradle is soft and warm

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into your wide open arms
No way to break this spell
Break this spell
Don't tell 
____


== Pineapple Head

[verse]
____
Detective is flat
No longer is always flat out
Got the number of the getaway car
Didn't get very far

As lucid as hell
These images moving so fast
Like a fever
So close to the bone
I don't feel too well

And if you choose
To take that path
I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark
To enflame you

Sleeping alone
For pleasure, the pineapple head
It spins and it spins
Like a number I hold
Don't remember if she was my friend
It was a long time ago

And if you choose
To take that path
I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark
to enflame you

Sleeping alone
For pleasure, the pineapple head
It spins and it spins
Like a number I hold
Don't remember if she was my friend
It was a long time ago

And if you choose
To take that path
Would you come to make me pay?

I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark

I will clutch at your heart
And come flying like a spark
To enflame you 
____


== When You Come

[verse]
____
When you come across the sea
Me like a beacon, guiding you to safety
The sooner the better now
And when you come
The hills will breathe like a baby
Pulled up, heaving from the bottom of the ocean
The sooner the better now
And when you come to cover me
Fresh with your kisses
Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den
I'll know you by the thunderclap
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions
And that is why
I stumble to my knees

And why, underneath the Heavens
With the stars burning and exploding
I know why I could never let you down
When you come

When you come like an iceberg float in darkness
Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea
I should know you better now
And when you come, your majesty to entrap me
Prince of light receding
The sooner the better now
And when you come to cover me
With your kisses hard like armour
The sooner the better now
I'll know you by the thunderclap
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions, hey
And that is why
I stumble to my knees

And why underneath the Heavens
With the stars burning and exploding
I know why I could never let you down

She came out of the water
Into my horizon
Like a cumulo nimbus
Coming in from the distance
Burning and exploding
Burning and exploding
Like a slow volcano
When you come
Cover the ground with ashes, with ashes
Baby, when you come
Nothing changes, now
When you come
Burning and exploding
When you come
When you come 
____

== Private Universe

[verse]
____
No time no place to talk about the weather
The promise of love is hard to ignore
You said the chance wasn't getting any better
Labour of love is ours to endure
The highest branch on the apple tree
It was my favourite place to be
I could hear them breaking free
But they could not see me

I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
It feels like nothing matters
In our private universe

I have all I want is that simple enough
There's a whole lot more I'm thinking of
Every night about six o'clock
The birds come back to the palm to talk
They talk to me, birds talk to me
If I go down on my knees

I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
It feels like nothing matters
In our private universe
It feels like nothing matters
In our private universe

And it's a pleasure that I have known
And it's a treasure that I have gained
And it's a pleasure that I have known

It's a tight squeeze but I won't let go
Time is on the table and the dinner's cold

I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
Feels like nothing matters
In our private universe

I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
Feels like nothing matters
In our private universe 
____

== Not The Girl You Think You Are

[verse]
____
You're not the girl you think you are
they're not his shoes under your bed
he'll take you places in his car
that you won't forget (no)
And all the people that you know
will turn their heads as you go by
but you'll be hard to recognize
with the top down and the wind blowing, blowing

He won't deceive you or tell you the truth
woman, he'll be no trouble
he won't write you letters
full of excuses
come on, believe you have one in a million

You're not the girl you think you are
someone's standing in your place
the bathroom mirror makes you look tall
but it's all in your head, in your head

He won't deceive you or tell you the truth
woman, he'll be no trouble
he won't write you letters
full of excuses
come on, believe you have one in a million

He won't deceive you or tell you the truth
come on, believe you have won
you're not the girl you think you are
believe you have won
you're not the girl you think you are
believe you have won
you're not the girl you think you are 
____

== Instinct

[verse]
____
I lit the match
I lit the match
I saw another monster turn to ash
felt the burden lifted from my back
do you recognize the nervous twitch
that exposes the weakness of the myth

when your turn comes 'round
and the light goes on
and you feel your attraction again
your instinct can't be wrong

separate the fiction from the fact
Been a little slow to react
but it's nearly time to flip the switch
and I'm hanging by a single stitch
laughing at the stony face of gloom

when your turn comes 'round
and the light goes on
and you feel your attraction again
your instinct can't be wrong

feelings come and go
where the true present lies are
calling down
laughing at the stony face of gloom

when your turn comes 'round
and the days get long
and you feel your attraction to him
your instinct can't be wrong

calling down 
____

== I Feel Possessed

[verse]
____
She said I could never do that
But I know you can, you are in my dream
We are one person, not two of a kind
And what was mine is now in your possession
I could feel you underneath my skin
As the wind rushed in, sent the kitchen table crashing
She said, nobody move, or I'll bring the house down

I hardly know which way is up
Or which way down
People are strange,
God only knows
I feel possessed when you come round

It was one of those times wished
I had a camera on me
Six foot off the ground
Well, I know how that sounds
Look above you and beyond me too
That kind of view don't need an explanation
I'm not lying, not asking for anything
I just want to be there when it happens again

I hardly know which way is up
Or which way down
People are strange
God only knows
I feel possessed when you come round

Whenever you invade my home
Everything I know flies out the window
It's above you and beyond me too
I don't want an explanation
But I'll be there when you bring the house down

I hardly know which way is up
Or which way down
People are strange
God only knows
I feel possessed when you come round
People are strange
I feel possessed when you come round 
____

== Four Seasons In One Day

[verse]
____
Four seasons in one day
Lying in the depths of your imagination
Worlds above and worlds below
Sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain

Even when you're feeling warm
The temperature could drop away
Like four seasons in one day

Smiling as the shit comes down
You can tell a man from what he has to say
Everything gets turned around
And I will risk my neck again, again

You can take me where you will
Up the creek and through the mill
Like all the things you can't explain
Four seasons in one day

Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day

Doesn't pay to make predictions
Sleeping on an unmade bed
Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain
Only one step away
Like four seasons in one day

Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day 
____

== It's Only Natural

[verse]
____
Ice will melt, water will boil
You and I can shake off this mortal coil
It's bigger than us
You don't have to worry about it

Ready or not, here comes the drop
You feel lucky when you know where you are
Y'know, it's gonna come true
Here in your arms, I remember

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

It's easy when you don't try going on first impressions
Man in a cage has made his confession
Now, you've seen me at my worst
And it won't be the last time I'm down there

I want you to know I feel completely at ease
Read me like a book
That's fallen down between your knees
Please, let me have my way with you

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

It's circumstantial
It's nothing written in the sky
And we don't even have to try

But we'll be shaking like mud
Buildings of glass
Sink into the bay
They'll be under the rocks again
You don't have to say
I know you're afraid

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

It's circumstantial
It's something I was born to
It's only natural
Can I help it if I want to? 
____

== Distant Sun

[verse]
____
Tell me all the things you would change
I don't pretend to know what you want
When you come around and spin my top
Time and again, time and again
No fire where I lit my spark
I am not afraid of the dark
Where your words devour my heart
And put me to shame, put me to shame

When your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
And dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

You're still so young to travel so far
Old enough to know who you are
Wise enough to carry the scars
Without any blame, there's no one to blame
It's easy to forget what you learned
Waiting for the thrill to return
Feeling your desire burn
You're drawn to the flame

When your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

And I'm lying on the table
Washed out in the flood
Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above
I don't pretend to know what you want
But I offer love

Seven worlds will collide
Whenever I am by your side
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

As time slips by, and on and on
Let your mind go, anywhere it wants, anywhere it wants
Let your mind
As time slips by, and on and on
Let your mind go, anywhere it wants, anywhere it wants
____

== Something So Strong

[verse]
____
Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Something so strong.... 
____

== Mean To Me

[verse]
____
She came all the way from America
She had a blind date with destiny
And the sound of Te Awamutu
Had a truly sacred ring
Now her parents
Are divorced
And her friend's committing suicide

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
She said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me

So I talked to you for an hour
In the bar of a small town hotel
And you asked me what I was thinking
I was thinking of a padded cell
With a black and white T.V.
To stop us from getting lonely

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
You said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me

You know I could not escape
A plea from the heart
Mysterious sympathy
I couldn't wait for a chance
Walk out the door
You know what it means to me

I...
I...

I saw you lying in the arms of a poet
I
I heard him tell you ta...tantalizing
Lies
What'd'ya know
Whad'd'ya know

I could not escape
You're down on the floor
You know what it means to me
I couldn't wait for a chance
Walk out the door
Mean...
Mean...
I could not escape
Down on my knees
You know what it means

What it means
What it means

In the arms of a poet
You know what it means 
____

== Better Be Home Soon

[verse]
____
Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever

[CHORUS]
And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

[CHORUS]

So don't say no
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause when you get back home
Maybe I'll be gone, oh

It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

[CHORUS]

Oh, that's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon 
____


== Everything Is Good For You

[verse]
____
I see a man with a flag
And he leads the procession
And a woman shedding tears
For a man locked in prison
Yeah...
Then the two locked eyes
And for a moment I was taken
And all paths lead
To a single conclusion
Yeah...

Everything is good for you
If it doesn't kill you
Everything is good for you
One man's ending
Is another man's beginning
Everything is good for you

It's a nightmare talking
To a restless ocean
With a reckless calm
To state their position
Oh...
But if you come undone
It might just set you free

Everything is good for you
If it doesn't kill you
Everything is good for you
One man's ending
Is another man's beginning

Bring back your head
Here comes trouble
To turn me and be well
Cover your heart

Everything is good for you
If it doesn't kill you
Everything is good for you
If it doesn't kill you

Everything is good for you
Is good for you
