== I Dance Like This

[verse]
____
In another dimension
Like clothes that you wear
A mighty mighty battle
Sprouting illegal hair
A fitness consultant
In the negative zone
Wandering the city
Looking for a home

I dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If I could dance better
Well you know that I would

How the rumour got started
One can only guess
And the truth don't mean nothing
If you ain't got the cash
A credit card mommy
An invisible dad
Career opportunities
That you never had

We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would

I'm working on my dancing
This is the best I can do
I'm tentatively shaking
You don't have to look
Can't say I'm sorry
I can't say I'm ashamed
Can't think of tomorrow
When it seems so far away

We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would
We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would

== Gasoline And Dirty Sheets

[verse]
____
Someone in a dangerous place
Someone got lost somewhere
Many people are locked outside
Many people lost out there

Many people they can't get in
Many people they pay no mind
Many people they leave this place
And many people are freed of time

Well now this man he could be king
This woman she's the royalty
This woman she's brave and strong
She's got no name but she is family

Gasoline and dirty sheets
Politics and painted face
She says that freedom costs too much
She says the mind is not place

This situation drags me down
They form a country in my house
On the stage and in the street
I will be a human being

I will come down off the stage
The marketplace and the shopping mall
Into the house, the rooms of war
Look at me now and recall

Vacuum-packed don't rock my world
And the money back guarantee don't make my day
And no feeling of security
They say the answer's one click away

Gasoline and dirty sheets
Politics and a painted face
She says that freedom costs too much
She says the mind is not place

Gasoline and dirty sheets
Politics and a painted face
She says that freedom costs too much
She says the mind is not place

== Every Day Is A Miracle

[verse]
____
The rose is pruned to a perfect shape
Perfect for whom, I wonder
The chicken thinks in mysterious ways
But beauty is not what we're after

Now the chicken imagines a heaven
Full of roosters and plenty of corn
And God is a very old rooster
And eggs are like Jesus, his son

Every day is miracle
Every day is an unpaid bill
You've got to sing for your supper
Love one another

Cockroach might eat Mona Lisa
The pope don't mean shit to a dog
And elephants don't read newspapers
And the kiss of a chicken is hot

The brain of a chicken
And the dick of a donkey
A pig in a blanket
And that's why you want me

What does it feel like
To be your tongue
Moving around in your mouth
To be free in the forest of your love
A cockroach in the cosmos of your house

Every day is miracle
Every day is an unpaid bill
You've got to sing for your supper
Love one another

I'm a blond, a brunette and a redhead
I thought up the birds and the bees
My software is famous all over
My money is growing on trees

The mind is a soft boiled potato
A jewel in a chocolate shell
I staple my love to your heart dear
With memories and beautiful smells

Every day is miracle
Every day is an unpaid bill
You've got to sing for your supper
Love one another

Every day is miracle
Every day is an unpaid bill
You've got to sing for your supper
Love one another

== Dog's Mind

[verse]
____
The judge was all hungover
When the president took the stand
So he didn't really notice
When things got out of hand

Then the press boys thank the president
And he tells them what to say
There's a photo opportunity
And then they're sent away

To a place where nothing matters
Where the wheels of progress turn
Where reality is fiction
But the dogs show no concern

Now the clerks look out the windows
At those dogs down in the park
Every window holds a staring face
Every desk stands piled with work

Now a dog cannot imagine
What it is to drive a car
And we in turn are limited
By what it is we are

We are dogs in our own paradise
In a theme park of our own
Doggy dancers doing doody
Doggy dreaming all day long

Dreaming all day long
Happy all day long
Dreaming all day long
In a paradise of our own

We are dogs in our own paradise
In a theme park of our own
Doggy dancers doing doody
Doggy dreaming all day long

== This Is That

[verse]
____
When the song comes on
When I hear them say
Everything stops
Everything changes
There's nothing special now
It's nothing profound
But something about the way it sounds
When the melody ends
And the rhythm kicks in
It knows where I'm at
And it knows where I've been

That's when I call you up
That's when my river overflows
That's when I use my cash card
That's when I think of who you are

That's when there's a knock at the door
And that's what we're doing it for
Well that's I got your message
That's when I sing this song
That's when he says it's over
That's when my life is in your hands now

That's when I call you up
That's when my river overflows
That's when I use my cash card
That's when I think of who you are

This is when
This is now
This is that
This is how
This is what
This is then
This is where

== It's Not Dark Up Here

[verse]
____
There's nothing funny about making money
It wouldn't work if it was
There's nothing funny about going to heaven
And there's nothing funny about love

Hey! It's not dark up here
Hey! It's not very far
Hey! It's cool in my house
Hey! It's loud in my car

It costs money if you want to party
And it costs money if you want to look
[?]
My hairdresser, she gives me the news

Hey! It's not dark up here
Hey! It's not very far
Hey! It's cool in my house
Hey! It's loud in my car

There's only one way to read a book
And there's only one way to watch tv
Well there's only one way to smell a flower
But there's millions of ways to be free

Does winter follow spring
Like night follows day
Must a question have an answer
Can't there be another way

Would you like to talk about it
Would you like to pull my hair
Plants have roots
But I don't know if they're deep enough to make me stay

Does winter follow spring
Like night follows day
Must a question have an answer
Can't there be another way

Hey! It's not dark up here
Hey! It's not very far
Hey! It's cool in my house
Hey! It's loud in my car 
____

== Bullet

[verse]
____
The bullet went into him
His skin did part in two
Skin that women had touched
The bullet passed on through

The bullet went into him
It went its merry way
Like an old grey dog
On a fox's trail

The bullet went into him
His stomach filled with food
Many fine meals he tasted there
But the bullet passed on through

The bullet went into him
It went its merry way
Like an old grey dog
On a fox's trail

The bullet went into him
Through his heart with thoughts of you
Where your kisses he inhaled
The lies and the truth

The bullet went into him
Traveled up into his head
Through thoughts of love and hate
The living and the dead

The bullet went into him
It went its merry way
Like an old grey dog
On a fox's trail

== Doing The Right Thing

[verse]
____
I'm always, I'm always doing the right thing (that's right)
I'm always, I'm always doing the right thing (help me now)
What am I supposed to do with this?
What am I supposed to know about this?
What am I supposed to have in my hands?
What is written on that paper you have?

I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing (help me now)

What am I not supposed to do now?
What's that and is it my business?
What exactly, exactly did you tell me?
What's good, does that mean it's right?

I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing

She and I visit the tourist shrines
We are proud of our automobile
She picks out some arts and crafts
I'm deep into the local cuisine
Let me show you my latest CD
Let me take you to the restaurant
Let me drive you to my country house
I hope you appreciate [?]

I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing

I'm not alone
And we're all the same
And the world won't end
It will just change its name
Now give me the bat
Give me the ball
This is my job
Let's get involved
Give me the phone
Give me the sign
Give me good luck
What's yours is mine

I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing
I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing
I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing
____

== Everybody's Coming To My House

[verse]
____
I wish I was a camera
I wish I was a postcard
I welcome you to my house
You didn't have to go far
A house and a garden
There are, there's plants and trees
Make a, a closer inspection
If you get, get down on your knees

Now everybody's coming to my house
And I'm never gonna  be alone
And everybody's coming to my house
And they're never gonna go back home

I'm pointing and describing
And I can be your guide
The skin is just a roadmap
The view is very nice
Imagine looking at a picture
Imagine driving in a car
Imagine rolling down the window
Imagine opening the door

Everybody's coming to my house
Everybody's coming to my house
I'm never gonna be alone
And they're never gonna go back home

We're only tourists in this life
Only tourists but the view is nice
And we're never gonna go back home
No we're never gonna go back home (all right)
We're only tourists in this life
Only tourists but the view is nice

Now everybody's coming to my house
And I'm never gonna be alone
And everybody's coming to my house
And they're never gonna go back home

Everybody's coming to my house
Everybody's coming to my house
I'm never gonna be alone
And I'm never gonna go back home
____

== Here

[verse]
____
Here is a region of abundant details
Here is a region that is seldom used
Here is a region that continues living
Even when the other sections are removed

Put your hand out of your pocket
Wipe the sweat off of your brow
Now it feels like a bad connection
No more information now

As it passes through your neurons
Like a whisper in the dark
Raise your eyes to the one who loves you
It is safe right where you are

Here is an area
Of great confusion
Here is a section
That's extremely precise

And here is an area
That needs attention
Here is a connection
With an opposite side

Here is many sounds
For your brain to comprehend
Here the sound is organised
Into things that make some sense

Here there is something
We call hallucination
Is it the truth or merely a description
