== Carson's Blues

[verse]
____
A wounded, sparrow
Timid and shy
A fallen deer, that's what they call me
But I'm an iron butterfly

A childish liar
A devilish bitch
I can be innocent and charming
And suddenly switch

But you've got to understand,
Understand, understand
That I've never belonged

I can be sweet
I can be wise
I've got everyone of you mirrored
In my deep, sad eyes

I know where you've been to
And who you're afraid to be
Cause nothing that is human
Is alien to me

I talk to strangers, strangers, strangers
One at a time

A wounded sparrow
Timid and shy
A fallen deer, that's what they call me
But I'm an iron butterfly

I know where you've been to
And who you're afraid to be
Cause nothing that is human
Is alien to me

I talk to strangers, strangers, strangers
One at a time

== New York Is My Destination

[verse]
____
New York is my destination.
New York is where I will be from.
New York is made for grander things.
Just. Like. Me.

I will lunch at the Algonquin.
Swing by the Plaza, waltz on in.
The Three Arts Club, I'll live there,
Indefinitely.

New York is made for grander things
Just. Like. Me.

Literati,
Yes, they will love me.
Paparazzi,
Well, could it be?
Glitterati,
Will they know of me?
New York's waiting for me.

All of the tales of seduction.
Glittering on the horizon.
Mountains of fame. And fortune. And snow
Finally.

New York is made for grander things
Just. Like. Me.

Literati,
Yes, they will love me.
Paparazzi,
Well, could it be?
Glitterati,
Will they know of me?
New York's waiting for me.

Practice at the Parnassus
Cram for Columbia classes
Ride the 5th Avenue busses
Weave some tale about us...

I lost all my money for Juilliard.
I hid in the phone booth at Масу's.
I slept in a brothel, on the way to
Destiny.

New York is made for grander things
Just. Like. Me.

Literati,
Yes, they will love me.
Paparazzi,
Well, could it be?
Glitterati,
Will they know of me?
New York's waiting for me.

New York is made for grander things.
Just. Like. Me.

== Instant Of The Hour After

[verse]
____
That's enough. Out of you.
Tonight. My darling.
This show is over for now.
The monkey is dead.
I detest all this drunken brawling.
Now let's see if you can make it into this bed.

How I love you. How I loathe you.

It's a sharp, quick love. I feel. My darling.
You're not as drunk as you seem. So why pretend.
On your cheek, that sweet shadow falling.
The pulse in your neck, how I'll know it, right to the end.
How I love you. How I loathe you.

All you can say is:
"Reverberating vacuity."
"Lousy simile."
"Vacant majesty."

In the instant of the hour after.

But right now. It's you and me.
My darling.
Trapped here inside of this bottle, drowning like flies.
When the frenzy's over.
We're crawling.
Specimens. Spent and exhausted,
We press to the sides.

How I love you. How I loathe you.

== We Of Me

[verse]
____
My squeezed heart divides
Into two wide wings
The world is
A sudden place
If you don't
Belong to anything

Noah may have got it wrong
There's one more
That could belong

This must be the
Irony of Fate
That I and the world
Are always separate

All other people
Have a we to claim
Except for me
And my own name

I belong to be
With the two of you
And we make three
As a family
That is why
You're the we of me
We of me

I belong to be
With the two of you
And we make three
As a family
That is why
You're the we of me
We of me

Noah's ark admitted, only two by two
We know this isn't always true
Noah may have got it wrong
There's one more that could belong

I belong to be
With the two of you
We make three
As a family
That is why
You are the we of me
The we of me

That is why
You are the we of me
The we of me

That is why
You are the we of me
The we of me

== Annemarie

[verse]
____
I saw your face
I'd knew you'd haunt me
For all... of my life.
Rising above me.
If you could want me, I'd be
No man's wife.

Everyone sees you
Everyone knows you
How can I possibly compare?
Who could attain you, with
All of your pain, who could
Possibly hold one so fair?
Terror, pity, love.
Annemarie.

Brilliant and stormy
Her perfect beauty
She moves through the world. With
Money and family
She glitters with trouble she's that
Kind of girl

Everyone wants you
Everyone loves you
How can I possibly compete?
Who can explain you
With all of your pain, who
Could possibly make you complet
Terror pity love.
Annemarie.

If I could see God
His face would be sacred
Like yours... Annemarie
But God's face is hidden and
Your face is suddenly
All I can see

Everyone worships you
Everyone needs you
How can I possibly complain?
Who will contain you,
With all of your pain, could I
Gather up all that you remain?
Terror pity love.
Annemarie.

== Twelve Mortal Men

[verse]
____
Where I'm from
There's poverty
All kinds of inequality

Nobody comes here
Nobody leaves

Don't have to go far
Even to see
The Whipping Report
In the library.
Hear one voice
Start singing
In the dirt
Twelve picks are ringing

Nobody comes here
Nobody leaves

Don't have to go far
Even to see
12 mortal men bound
In a song of liberty.

Don't have to go far
The music I hear,
Is 12 mortal men singing
In ecstasy and fear.

In my heart
I see a crowd
A thousand, souls marching and proud

Everyone gathered
Each one is loved.

== Harper Lee

[verse]
____
Virginia Woolf
She leaves me cold
I recognize the genius
But I'm twice as bold

I have more to say
Than Hemingway
Lord knows, compared to Faulker
I say it in a better way

Graham Greene
He loves me
He loves my poetic
Sensibility

Katherine Anne Porter
Might be the best one now
But in about a year
I'm gonna show her how

Yes I will

Said to Reeves the other day
Proust really is the man
Who comforts me in a way
No other writer can

The timeless quality of the work
The length! Is very long
Believe me Marcel Proust goes on
And on and on and on. 7 volumes

Oh, Harper. Harper
Lee. Lee. Lee
She only wrote that one book
I've written more than three

Darling Tennessee Williams
It's anybody's guess
Why "Streetcar" made millions
And "Wedding" so much less

I will forever be pondering that one

Oh, Harper. Harper
Lee. Lee. Lee
Why do they always compare her to me
To me

Won't even talk about
Eudora Welty
As for F. Scott, my Sad Cafe
Is greater than his Gatsby
I'm just telling you
What someone told me they read
I never look at my reviews
They might give me the big head
Now Truman Capote was hypnotized
Mesmerized. Cause he realized
That I knew that he knew
That he had plagiarized

My cadences!
Imagine his surprise,
You'll see it in his eyes
When I win that Nobel Prize

Thank you. Thank you so very much

Harper. Harper
Lee. Lee. Lee
Why do they always compare her to me
To me

She always seems to be receiving
More than she deserves
Honey, she's poaching on
My literary preserves

Yes from Harper Lee
We have seen and we've heard and
I'd like to kill more than just
That mocking bird

You know, sometimes I really would
So you just wait until next year

== Lover, Beloved

[verse]
____
Lover Beloved
Behold each of these
The lover pursues.
The beloved one fLees.

Lover Beloved
From countries apart
Each one alone
In the land of the heart
Each one alone in the land of the heart

Lover Beloved
Forever stripped bare.
Turn in the night
And it's he who is there

Liar and lover
And hero, and thief
Turn in the night
And he brings no relief
Brother, or husband
He brings no relief

The man across the Styx, will send
Flowers from beyond the end
The man across the Styx will be
Her lover for eternity

Lover Beloved
Her brave cavalier
All of his love
Raising hatred and fear

Lover Beloved
Each craving the touch
Each bears the burden
Of loving too much
Each bears the burden
Of loving too much

The man across the Styx, will send
Flowers from beyond the end
The man across the Styx will be
Her lover for eternity

Lover Beloved
Behold both of these.
Lover pursues.
Beloved one flees.

Lover Beloved
From countries apart
Each one alone
In the land of the heart
Each one alone in the land of the heart.

== The Ballad Of Miss Amelia

[verse]
____
On any southern afternoon
If anyone would care to look
A face appears inside a house
A terrible face
It is sexless
And white
It is dim
Like the faces
In dreams...

It's Miss Amelia
She's waiting by the window
Remembering the laughing
In the cafe down below

Once Miss Amelia
Married a man
She married Marvin Масу
No one could understand

She must have done it for the presents
Cause she didn't like him much
And even on their wedding night
She wouldn't let him touch

Well, he hung around the doorways
Acting foolish with bliss
Until he came too close one day
She swung once with her fist

Miss Amelia was a strong woman
She was big and tall
Swung once and Marvin Масу
Well he fell against the wall

Now Miss Amelia is
Sitting by the shutters
Remembering the laughing
In the cafe long ago...

After Marvin Масу
Had long gone away
A little hunchback came to town
And this is strange to say

That Miss Amelia who had never loved
She fell in love with him
He was a skipping little troublemaker
Still she took him in

And so they lived together
And were happy for a time
Everybody came around
And they would drink and dine

Miss Amelia made a whiskey
It was fine and it was rare
Would warm a man into his soul
And show' the writing there

Miss Amelia's story
Is simple and sad
Marvin Масу, he returned to town
With all the evil that he had

The skipping little hunchback
He was quite impressed
With Marvin Macy's history
Of robbery and the rest

I will not get specific
But just let it now be said
There was terrible light one night
And Miss Amelia was ahead
Until the little hunchback
Jumped in on Marvin Macy's side

Everybody all agreed
That's the night the cafe died

On any southern afternoon
If anyone would care to look
A face appears inside a house
A terrible face
It is sexless and white
It is dim
Like the faces
In dreams

It's Miss Amelia
She's waiting by the window
Remembering the laughing
In the cafe down below

It's Miss Amelia
Sitting by the shutters
Remembering the laughing
In the cafe long ago...

== Carson's Last Supper

[verse]
____
I love the world.
Sometimes it loves me.
The love of my life

Is humanity.
The rich and the poor
The broken and whole
All come together
Feeding the soul
Each one belongs at this feast.

Drink to the pleasures!
Drink for the pains.
Drink for the losses.
Drink to the gains!
The humble the twisted
The proud and the grand

Sinner and sinned against
This is my stand
Each one belongs at this feast.

Come and be at this table
Come and take what is mine to share with you
And if you are able
You must give what is thine to give
Thine to give, forever
We'll be as one solid body together

Drink for the sorrows
Drink to the bliss
Drink to the raptures of Eros Urst kiss
One strong true purpose
No thought of return
No rest or hope of rest
The visions still burn
Each one belongs at this feast.

Come and be at this table
Come and take what is mine to share with you
And if you are able
You must give what is thine to give
Thine to give, forever
We'll be as one solid body together

Come and be at this table
Come and take what is mine to share with you
And if you are able
You must give what is thine to give
Thine to give, forever
We'll be as one solid body together

I love the world.
Sometimes it loves me.
The love of my life,

Is humanity.
