== Again

[verse]
____
(Again)
(Again)
I've found again
(Again)
A space in my heart again
(Again)
For the God again
(Again)
In the form of art again
(Again)

I let it flow
(Again)
Into a bottomless hole again
As I feel it (again) ripple and ready its soul again
Alone again (again)
Home

We fall again
(Again)
Under the spell again
(Again)
And crawl again
(Again)
Into the shell
(Again)

And let it flow
(Again)
Into a bottomless hole again
As I feel it ripple and ready its soul again
Alone again (again)
Home

(Again)
(Again)
(Again)
(Again)

I let it flow
(Again)
Into a bottomless hole again
As I feel it ripple and ready its soul again
Alone again (again)
Home

(Again)
(Again)
(Again)

== A Trick Of The Light

[verse]
____
My heart is spilling over
Crashing on the ground
I can't see what's around me
But soon I'll come around
My faith is in the balance
Of a million tiny words
So I return to silence

And if I see a sign in the sky tonight
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light
May never come but I'm willing to wait
What can I say I'm a man of the faith
And there's an ocean in my body
And there's a river in my soul
And I'm crying

It's time when I let go
Of things I can't control
This path that I've taken
Is the only one I know
Well I've come so far to get here
And I've got so far to go
So I'll take what I can get
In matters of the soul

And if I see a sign in the sky tonight
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light
May never come but I'm willing to wait
What can I say I'm a man of the faith
And there's an ocean in my body
And there's a river in my soul
And I'm crying

And we are the dawn
And we carry the sun
And we are the dawn
And we carry the sun

And if I see a sign in the sky tonight
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light
May never come but I'm willing to wait
What can I say I'm a man of the faith
And there's an ocean in my body
And there's a river in my soul
And I'm crying

(See it coming)
And if I see a sign in the sky tonight (see it coming)
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light (feel it coming)
May never come but I'm willing to wait (see it coming)
What can I say I'm a man of the faith (feel it coming)
And there's an ocean in my body (see it coming)
And there's a river in my soul (see it coming)
And I'm crying

== Sweet Saviour

[verse]
____
Awaking from another dream
I saw your picture on the screen
It took me to another place in time
Below the woven tapestry
Of transcendental memory
The fountain of potential in its prime

Every day the soul turns your body so divine
And every day the heart beats so fast it clamps your mind

And all that float into the night
It's seemingly no end in sight
I drank it all, I could not stand
And from the floor I played my hand

And I swear I saw eternity
And the sister sailin'
Softly somwehere, oh sweet saviour
Save me oh sweet saviour, save me

Every day the soul turns your body so divine
And every day the heart beats so fast it clamps your mind

I've been praising you now
For what feels like eternity
Sweet saviour, don't do this to me
Sweet saviour

Every day the soul turns your body so divine
And every day the heart beats so fast it clamps your mind

I've been praising you now
For what feels like eternity
Sweet saviour, don't do this to me
Sweet saviour
I've been loving you now
For what feels like eternity
Sweet saviour, don't do this to me
____

== Long Time Waiting

[verse]
____
This is enough to give your money a run
Procrastinating till the kingdom come
You tell yourself that you do what you can
Well, what will you do when the shit hits the fan
They're out to get you, all of them, excuse me but
Nobody said it was gonna be easy
I see you crying, just give me your hand
You can't sit back when you're taking a stand

If you believe that your time is coming
But you're counting on your savior to come
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time
If you believe that it's for the taking
But somebody's gonna do it for you
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time

I could do without this talk of getting ahead
When it's a battle just to get out of bed
My will is strong but it's starting to break
There's only so much a body can take
I get your message but I don't like the tone
You can only help yourself, and you alone

If you believe that your time is coming
But you're counting on your savior to come
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time
If you believe that it's for the taking
But somebody's gonna do it for you
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time

I don't need no validation
From anyone at any cost
A trophy consolation
For something that I never lost
I need, I need to know
How to feel the way you say, you say you do
So I can give some validation to you

I don't need no validation
From anyone at any cost
A trophy consolation
For something that I never lost
I need, I need to know
How to feel the way you say, you say you do
So I can give some validation to you

No I don't need no validation
From anyone at any cost
A trophy consolation
For something that I never lost

If you believe that your time is coming
But you're counting on your savior to come
You'll be a long time waiting
You'll be a long time
If you believe that it's for the taking
But somebody's gonna do it for you
You'll be a long time waiting
You'll be a long time

== Fool

[verse]
____
Like any modern dog
I choose what I can see
From any infomercial to the bodies on the street
And for now I keep my head down
But one day I will precede
My reputation

'Cause I'm a fool love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there's no need to worry

And the world is passin' by you
But you'll miss if you blink
And the future has been written
But the pen ran out ink
And the dopamine is dripping back
Into the kitchen sink
Send your location

'Cause I'm a fool love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there's no need to worry

So here is my bleeding heart
Will you be my falling star?
Will you take the pain away?

There's money in the morning
And I'm looking at my screen
And fail to accept that there's a problem to the scene, too
There's a problem

'Cause I'm a fool, love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there's no need to worry

I'm a fool love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there's no need to worry

== Love Came With All That It Brings

[verse]
____
She was just doing her thing
That love came with all that it brings
Her longbows were lost in the rain
When she severed her heart
With the blade

And hell is a place that's reserved
For people it fully deserves
So she's packing her bags just in case
They've saved her her own special place

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Love came with all that it brings
Including the fact that it stings
Like a motherfucker
Love came with all that it brings
And just as the fat lady sings
We want more

Love came with all that it brings
Including the fact that it stings
Like a motherfucker
Love came with all that it brings
And just as the fat lady sings
We want more

== Real Go - Getter

[verse]
____
Give all you got
If you're feeling like you've had enough
There's only one way and it's always up
It's always tough
But if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me

Things have got better I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better I'm a real go-getter

It's good enough for me

Things have got better I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better I'm a real go-getter
Things have got bet-

== Hold Me Down

[verse]
____
I've see the dark
But there's something in the way
And I can't get out
I'm in a room
But I don't know how I got here
Or what I'm allowed

So come inside
Pick a fight
Ruffle my feather
I'll be waiting here
Patiently
Wondering whether
Hope is a lie

Hold me down till I can't understand who I am
Pull me out of this home
Pull me down till your body spills into my soul

The sun goes out
And I need it like I need
A hole in my head
My voices shout
But I can't remember
Or sing a word that I said

So count me in
Take me on
Kill all my memory
I can't believe
Can't go on
Never be care-free
If hope is a lie

Hold me down till I can't understand who I am
Pull me out of this home
Pull me down till your body spills into my soul

Then leave me be
Alone to dream
Another love
Is calming me
____

== Ada

[verse]
____
Ada, didn't you know
You are the mud in which I lie
And Ada, didn't you know
You are the sun in which I reside
And Ada, didn't you know
You are the hole in which I hide
And Ada, didn't you know
You are the crown in which I cry
And Ada, didn't you know
You are the dream in which I die

And Ada, I feel like a silver moon
Ada, I feel like a silver moon
Ada, I feel like a silver moon
Ada, I feel like a silver moon
