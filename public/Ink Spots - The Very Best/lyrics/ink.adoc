== If I Didn't Care

// https://www.google.com/search?q=Ink+Spots+lyrics+If+I+Didn't+Care

[verse]
____
If I didn't care, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go round and round while my heart stand still?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true, if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
And Darlin', if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what make my head go round and round while my heart just stand still so much?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true, if I didn't care for you?

I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the jiving and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup

In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

[verse]
____
Someone's rocking my dreamboat,
Someone's invading my dream;
We were sailing along,
So peaceful and calm,
Suddenly, something went wrong.

Someone's rocking my dreamboat,
Disturbing a beautiful dream;
It's a mystery to me,
This mutiny at sea,
Who can it be?

A friendly breeze gave us a start
To a paradise of our own.
All at once a storm blew us apart,
And left me drifting alone.

Someone's rocking my dreamboat,
I'm captain without any crew;
But with love as my guide,
I'll follow the tide,
I'll keep sailing till I find you.

And left me drifting alone.

[verse]
____
Do I worry cause you're stepping out
Do I worry cause you got me in doubt
Though your kisses aren't right, do I give a bag of beans
Do I stay home every night and read my magazine

Am I frantic, cause we lost that spark
Is there panic when it starts turning dark
And when evening shadows creep, do I loose any sleep over you
Do I worry, you can bet your life I do

Do I worry when the iceman calls
Do I worry if Niagra Falls
Though you treat me just like dirt
You think I give a snap
Are my feelings really hurt
When you're sitting in somebody else's lap
Am I curious when the gossip flies
Am I furious bout your little white lies
And when all our evenings end
Cause you got a sick friend that needs you
Do I worry, honey, you know dog gone well I do

Am I frantic, cause we've lost that spark
Is ther panic when it starts turning dark
And when evening shadows creep
Do I lose any sleep over you
Do I worry, you can bet your life, I do

[verse]
____
Slap that bass
Slap it till it's dizzy
Slap that bass
Keep the rhythm busy
Zoom zoom zoom
Misery, you've got to go

Slap that bass
Use it like a tonic
Slap that bass
Keep your Philharmonic
Zoom zoom zoom
And the milk and honey'll flow

Dictators would be better off
If they zoom zoom now and then
Today, you can see that the happiest men
All got rhythm

In which case
If you want a bauble
Slap that bass
Slap away your trouble
Learn to zoom zoom zoom
Slap that bass

Zoom zoom, zoom zoom
The World is in a mess
With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes
There's no happiness

Zoom zoom, zoom zoom
Rhythm lead your ace
The future doesn't fret me
If I can only get me
Someone to slap that bass

Happiness is not a riddle
When I'm listening to that
Big bass fiddle

Slap that bass
(Slap those feet)
I said slap that bass
(We said slap those feet)
Alright, slap that bass
And I'll slap these feet

Well slap my face
Can he slap that bass
(Feet)
Bass
(Bass)
Bass

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh darling I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why stir up memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh darling I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why stir up memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
