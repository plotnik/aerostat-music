== Camp Hill Rail Operator

[verse]
____
In care of his contraption mad camp hill rail operator woman
Is she speaking from the heart?
Maybe blasting from another world?
Or just the emissary of a higher court inside the body of a girl?
Does she want to take control?
When her eight track breaks down will she take my bus home?
In care of his contraption mad camp hill rail operator woman
Is this some sort of reverie for the
One woman Jan and Dean heading for the crash?
Is she half who she ought to be
Or a overdue prodigy
Whose unsolicited view of your present's confused with her past?
At a table by the door
Of my moment but she can't sit still,
And when I crash upon the floor she'll come across the stage
and finish out the bill,
She throws one switch and all trains are in space
What she lays on those tracks you can't ever erase
In care of his contraption mad camp hill rail operator woman, yeah

== Homefront Cameo

[verse]
____
Everything is better the boss has made a cameo
He has seen the infidel army like a prince of old
Listen to him twist her faith, he's been out there all day
Sleeping on the laurels of a face from long ago

As matters complicate, it's a terrible thing to wait
Everything is better, the boss has made a cameo
He has seen the infidel army like a prince of old
She's made the bed three times today

Each a masterpiece in its own way
And takes his name in vain
From this vantage point she is making her plans
Kiss goodbye to this your century map
She calls her future back, takes his wine from the rack

He wants a glass of water but she sweetly mouths her no
Then like an arrow she's let go, arcing from the poison beau
Everything is better, the boss has made a cameo
She has seen the infidel army like a prince of old
____

== Spin My Wheels

[verse]
____
You run away with my sleep and I'm stuck in here so deep
I had a terrible dream and I can't wake up it seems
In my parallel field, what's imagined is real
For you I conceal, all that I feel and girl you spin my wheels
I've got a terrible mind, maybe desperate or unkind
Thinking of ways to dispose of the ones we say we love the most
I want to carry you home, I want to see you alone
For we will never show all that we feel and girl you spin my wheels
____

== My Before And After

[verse]
____
She picked me out of the millions
Thumbing an OED
Dressed me down to civilian
Cracks the code on the Rosetta Stone
Said the word for alone is "alone"
My before and after 
My before and after
My before and after, Her

We found that R Mutt was truly
Some work of genius 
She helped my best friends see through me
Said the church of his holiness lied
This world's no dead end, it's park and ride
My before and after 
My before and after
My before and after, Her

Now I'm dangerously reprogrammed man
Like that guy in the Manchurian
My before and after 
My before and after
My before and after, Her
____

== Private Ruth

[verse]
____
She used to love me and that was such an obstacle
Running around in the bad hand me downs of someone else's girl
She's using my name and making a face
As if to say all that she's been has been erased
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth

She's tired of loving the ones she knows she's better than
Moving the men on a chessboard full of all her so called friends
Or maybe she just wants me a drone
Proclaiming edicts from the queen bee in her cone
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth, you hate
Private Ruth
You hate
You hate
____

== Vegetable Row

[verse]
____
I hear when you talk that not much goes on
And now I think you might be the dark right before my dawn
And the clouds have made a fissure I've arranged that for you mister
So that you can go ahead and prematurely start the process of preserving

You look so afraid and I can see why
You just turned your back on a very dangerous guy
And the bells ring with a vengeance as we witness your ascension
To a land where they can things better than all the "Bells of Rhymny"

On vegetable row, vegetable row
On vegetable row, vegetable row
Think of us in your new haunt

They must have let classes out early those days
And I bet you were the funniest clown at the front of the hip parade
Now you shadows swirl around us, take us back to where you found us
Crawl back underneath you couch and tell us things are a little bit skewed

On vegetable row, vegetable row
On vegetable row, vegetable row

I'm thinking of a place where time's your boss
And now you just can't wait
To turn in your only key, pass your baton to me
Sell yourself penny cheap and never stop to total up the cost

Some people give up on the third or fourth try
And some can make a career out of just trying to say goodbye
They've been holding your place, someone's here to fill that space
And it's a mighty act of grace you won't have me around
To check you vital signs

On vegetable row, vegetable row
On vegetable row, vegetable row
Think of us in your new
Think of us in your new haunt

== Aurora Bori Alice

[verse]
____
Alice can you hear me, tonight the sky's not clearing
You'll never see Cassiopeia
You're there at your department, I'm here in your apartment
Another night I'll spend alone
A girl, her telescope, and the great unknown
Alice in ugly weather
You said we'd be together, and not afraid to let it show
The Pleiades behind her, Orion should remind her
Of summer boy she's got at home
She loves her telescope more than I'd known, oh...
Aurora Bori Alice, do you think there's someone out in space for you?
I want to be the man to change your point of view
And if your hear me Alice, redirect your looking glass to earthly heights
See a man who loves you so much more than Northern Lights
____

== Church of Wilson

[verse]
____
Give yourself away if you want
How did your Daddy get so gaunt
It's a pretty face that you know
(???)
What's a boy to do when a girl's untrue
Put your bell on your bike
And it's not my right to kill, son
I'm an acolyte from the mighty
Church of Wilson

Yeah the world's a mess and I know
You don't need me to tell you so
Who's it gonna hurt to be King
Playing in the shiny things
Want to make my move to
The throwback groove
While there's stream in the pipes
And it's not my right to kill, son
I'm an acolyte from the mighty
Church of Wilson
Church of Wilson
____

== Lily Dreams On

[verse]
____
Lily I hope you picture me in your dreams
Put down your King James Bible, you don't need no kings
Close you eyes, baby I'll dry mine
Echo through the phone
Far from this, Lily dreams on

Think back to fields of Catherine, you used to play
I swore I heard you laughing
And almost say
Pull your mirrors down, took away the glass
And let the past be gone
Far from this, Lily dreams on
____

== Password

[verse]
____
Lift your latch and let me pass that's all I'm asking girl
And forgive what's unorthodox
I fashioned this to slip your locks so we might have a word
We had a fight I won last night but who slept outside girl?
What if I'm wrong, help me along to give a bit and still look strong
I want to tell the world
Key to the lock of the heard Password, is something I believe we've earned
And If you're told I'm bought and sold and soulless to be sure
Your friends would fight for your advice
"It must be weird, he looked so nice, you're such a lucky girl"
Key to the lock of the heard Password, its something I believe we've earned
Password, give us back what we deserve
____

== Animal Drinking Show Song

[verse]
____
Took an exit sign to a world of motel time
Where we walk a crooked line and high is low
Trust your sad MC, time to kill the bar Telly
When the lights come on you'll see we're still alone
Watch the saints weave slow
From the animal show, animal show, animal show
____

== Prophecy For The Golden Age

== She's Only Cool

[verse]
____
She mixes you up and makes you come down
And I'm gone enough to fall for that now
She's only cool tonight and I've lost your sight
But that lullaby can never get me home

I've seen a few things I think you could say
My words fail me now and it's better that way
She's only cool tonight and I've lost your sight
But that lullaby can never get me home

Each night that I spend away is one more I have to behave
But she makes it seem so cool not to cave

She's only cool tonight
And I've lost your sight
Still that lullaby
Can never get me

She's only cool tonight
But that lullaby
Can never get me home
____

== Autumn's Birds

[verse]
____
Prayed for "Endless Summer" made a wish to "Little Wing"
But you gave the world your number and your phone don't ring
Oh uh oh... begging for an early heart attack... Oh uh oh
You've seen the great migration from the world that's locked in ice
And you wear your change of station like a faded sticker price
Oh uh oh... begging for an early heart attack... Oh uh oh
I surrender she flew
Under sun split sky drenched crystalline blue
Where autumn's birds are killing you
In your long coat down by the song tree
Are you watching a girl no one else can see
From the days of enervation man you need some elevation
Would that the explanation were just part of some bad dream
And when you think you're with it still, the girls know who you are
You could say the sky's the limit, but you'll never be a star
Uh oh... begging for an early heart attack Uh oh...
Ah surrender she flew
Under sun split sky drenched crystalline blue
Where autumn's birds are killing you
