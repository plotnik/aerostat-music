== The Book Of Too Late Changes

http://ichingsongs.com/book-late-changes/

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Hey does anybody know me
The cops of [?] surrounds me
They never seem to look us in the eyes
But magically appear to come and ride’
And if you care to look
I think I may write you a book
I’ll entitle it my book of too late changes

[Verse 1]
Hey does anybody hear me
The way you get to wear cool
Will roughly appears
And nothing seems to thrive
I bite that fruit and only taste the rind
For something great and sweet and tangy, there’s a lot of reek
To reprise you from my book of too late changes

[Verse 3]
Hey does anybody else hear me
The two resurrection of the lost and bittersweet
Our armour and our [?]
[?] turns to stone and [?]
When [?] turn desire
Rise up and go forth to the fire
Where we offer up the book of too late changes
Where we offer up the book of too late changes

== Close To The Sun

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Climb inside the mansion of actions
Climb toward the mysteries of creation
We lurk in skies and a part of [?]
The statue where it comes
Legend comes for a slumber

[Chorus]
Next to the wonder, that’s to the thunder
Close to the sun

[Verse 2]
I want you my love
But I feel destined for a different sort of medicine
I’ve got to transcribe what’s inside into these [?] of Edison
Faces fresh I can’t stand [?]
Feel the warmth of love
Waking up for a slumber

[Chorus]
Next to the wonder that’s to the thunder
And close to the sun
I’m close to the sun

Sun, sun, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh

I’m going to rise above the pyramid
Just can’t see enough
I would try to say I love you girl
But you missed the [?]

[Outro]
We lurk in skies and a part of [?]
The statue where it comes
Legend comes for a slumber
Next to the wonder, that’s to the thunder
And close to the sun
Close to the sun
Close to the sun
Close to the sun

== The Middle Of Nowhere

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Slip the mornings of the all familiar
Getting to a second car
And go somewhere late
Looking out the window
And I see we’re in another state
Now we’re standing
And the clouds rush the sky
In the sweetness of the morning stars
You glow, take my hand
Tell me that you’re really in the presence of a wanted man

[Chorus]
The middle of nowhere is an easy place
I’m taking you there, all the way
The middle of nowhere I can see your face
I’m with you my love, all the way

[Verse 2]
I just found you
And the bells crack the sky
And the workers fall into a day
They’re now learning to see
To never separate us
From the moment that will always be

[Chorus]
The middle of nowhere is an easy place
I’m taking you there, all the way
The middle of nowhere I can see your face
I’m with you my love, all the way

[verse]
____
[Chorus]
This is right candy lilac
Hold nothing back on me
I’m falling face
With an amazing girl

[Verse 1]
Give me time candy lilac
You get exact on me
Oh darling don’t try
To arrange the world
In the broken cave
Your shoulders take
Walking up the ladder
When I turn to you and hay

[Chorus]
Are you mine candy lilac
Then we should act on it
Oh I’m faced
With an amazing girl

[Verse 2]
In another world
I know the way
To keep you here beside me
And you’re fine enough to stay

== Life Of The Liar

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Did you ever find that
Inside your li-li-li-life with a liar
Did you ever build a house
And somebody would set it on fire

[Chorus]
What’d I do wrong
Running round the room
Wondering why I ever took so long
And if I had a dollar for every time I should’ve gone
Oh

[Verse 2]
Did you ever find that
Inside your li-li-li-life with a thief
Planning in New Delhi
When you only want a little relief
It’s all for now

[Chorus]
I only wanna give back
All the stolen merchandise I bought
And if I had a dollar
For every crime I could’ve gone

[Outro]
It’s only just a story
But I know it’s so much more than this
I’m so elated to [?] me with a kiss
Oh - oh

The life of a liar
Oh the life of a liar

== The Land Of Flowers

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the land of flowers
Everything is overgrown
There lie my hours
Underneath the sun rockstone

[Chorus]
You could say a once great prince
Surrendered his kingdom to the wild
But we’ll take back some days
And if you come around again
I could make it worth your while
Counting down from ten
Like a little child

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the land of flowers
Nothing here disrupts the soil
There lie my earthly powers
Far from any trouble up top

[Chorus]
You could say a once great man
Delivered his reason to the night
But we’ll take back some days
And if you come around again
I could make it worth your while
Counting down from ten
Like a little child
You could say a once great prince
Surrendered his kingdom to the wild
But we’ll take back some days
And if you come around again
I could make it worth your while
Counting down from ten
Like a little child

== Never Be It

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
I tried walking through the open door
Just like these nights don't matter
This time
The [?] a whole lot more
And my heart is so shattered now

[Chorus]
Cause my girl says I'll never be it
Looking in the mirror and she's taking a trip
She goes round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 2]
I thought
We made a little place for love
Just like a church on sunday and thought
Another roll of a Persian rug
It's like the one she just pulled out

[Chorus]
Cause my girl says I'll never be it
Looking in the mirror and she's taking a trip
She goes round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 3]
I never thought this would be love
But our heart will do what it's meant to do
I'm haunted by the picture of [?] what's sitting next to you
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
She says
It's really been a [?]
But this must be the last time I beg
Shadows not to take the wall
And I feel so broken now

[Chorus]
Cause my girl says I'll never be it
Looking in the mirror and she's taking a trip
She goes round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round

== Queen Of Swords

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
First you lie awake
Then you make mistakes
And through the powers of heartache
And love the queen of swords
You shut the door
Meet you in the dark
Someone's up your heart
And calls devotion a lost art
Loves the king of blades
Add a [?]

[Chorus]
Fallen roses
Underneath a world you cannot see
She's gone forever
Where she goes has nothing anymore to do with me
Will time will weather

[Verse 2]
Ends a [?]
Takes the sober cat
And says your mouth is undone yet
Says that that's not true
All around you

== Waters Raging

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
I don't want to meet you
Cause baby I feel you
I'm losing all my fans
And coming in inside
Coming in inside
I got the voice of a feeling
And now you really got me kneeling
I'm looking for some line
And coming in inside
Coming in inside

[Chorus]
Forecasting waters raging
Waters raging

[Verse 2]
Curse of the tame
Is the [?] of lovers lane
I only read about it in a book
Then my girl just gives me dirty looks

[Chorus]
Forecasting waters raging
Waters raging
[?] inside
Forecasting waters raging
Waters raging

== Child Bride

http://ichingsongs.com/child-bride/

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Have you ever heard
An answer to forgiveness
Extract each deed from word
And kill the only witness

[Chorus]
Downhills time flies
Funny thing to say
She's your child bride
Ask all the way

[Verse 2]
In the sum total
Are words we never spoken
The ethical of love
And how it all gets broken

[Chorus]
Downhills time flies
Funny thing to say
She's your child bride
Ask all the way

[Verse 3]
This [?] understanding has pushed us to be
Know your words are a [?]
Is written on your face in invisible ink
Be careful what you say
The world is disembodied
Through innocence we wanna stray
When love became a hobby

[Chorus]
Downhills time flies
Funny thing to say
She's your child bride
Ask all the way

[verse]
____
[Verse 1]
Baby it's clear
There's no search party near
And I'll die if I strike out on my own
Might not ever get home
I'm living on Tums Snowmelt and Gum
In a storm of the switch pack left the road
So I wrote you this note

[Chorus]
I'm the boy who dreams of summer
In the unrelenting snow
Like a little lost crow

[Verse 2]
Tonight when we touch I melted too much
For i'm locked in an ancient glacier cold
Get this car on the road

[Chorus]
I'm the boy who dreams of summer
In the unforgiving snow

Call me back girl use this number here it's twenty-six below
I got a mind to break the [?]
Sell my future down across the street
But my hands are getting cold
