== LowDown

[verse]
____
She's a crooked sheriff in a real straight town
She openend the door, shake shake shake the lights go down
Clover honey and the Jimson Weed
Red leather skirt way up above her knees
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown

She's a gone lost dirt road
There ain't no way back I been told
Well she's a story they all tell
She's a rebel, she's a yell
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown

White heat in a cold rain
I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane
Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al

The second hand moon's shining for my gal
She's a big red flag in a mean bullpen
She'll steal it from you, sell it right back to you again
Well, she's a wild rose, she's not settled
Cold gun of ice blue metal,
Oh, my baby's lowdown

White heat in a cold rain
I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane
Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al

She's a cheap motel with a burned out sign
She'll take care of you definitely every time
She got a stolen check book and legs up to there
Singing into a hairbrush, right in front of the mirror
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown

== 2:19

[verse]
____
I lost everything I had in the '29 flood
The barn was buried 'neath a mile of mud
Now I've got nothing but the whistle and the steam
My baby's leaving town on the 2:19

I said, hey, hey, I don't know what to do
I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don't know what to do
My baby's leaving town on the 2:19

Now there's a fellow that's preaching 'bout hell and damnation
Bouncing off the walls of the Grand Central Station
I treated her bad, I treated her mean
Baby's leaving town on the 2:19

I said, hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don't know what to do
Hey, I don't know what to do
My baby's leaving town on the 2:19

Now I've always been puzzled by the yin and the yang
It'll come out in the wash, but it always leaves a stain
Sturm and Drang, the luster and the sheen
My baby's leaving town on the -

Hey, hey, I don't know what to do
Hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I will remember you
My baby's leaving town on the 2:19

Lost the baby with the water, and the preacher stole the bride
Sent her out for a bottle, but when she came back inside
She didn't have my whiskey, didn't have my gin
With a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin

I said, hey, hey, I will remember you
Yeah baby, I will remember you
My baby's leaving town on the 2:19

On the train you get smaller, as you get farther away
The roar covers everything you wanted to say
Was that a raindrop or a tear in your eye?
Were you drying your nails or waving goodbye?

Hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don't know what to do
Oh baby
My baby's leaving town on the 2:19

I will remember you
I don't know what to do, baby

== Fish In The Jailhouse

[verse]
____
Peoria Johnson told Dirty Ol' Joe
I can break out of any old jail, you know

All I need me is an old fishbone

Fish in the jailhouse tonight, all right, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, all right, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, all right, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse
Fish in the jailhouse tonight

Well, a steelhead salmon or a mud bank carp

And on Saturday night I'll be in Central Park

Fish in the jailhouse tonight, all right, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, all right, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, all right, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse
Fish in the jailhouse tonight

Ask Little Slow Jackson, on a forty-four trip
Ask Whipperfield[?] Farraday, ask what I did

From Natchez(2) to Kenosha, runnin' down to New York

== Bottom Of The World

[verse]
____
My daddy told me, lookin' back
The best friend you'll have is a railroad track
So when I was 13 said, I'm rollin' my own,
And I'm leavin' Missouri and I'm never comin' home

And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

Satchel Puddin' and Lord God Mose
Sitting by the fire with a busted nose
That fresh egg yeller is too damn rare
But the white part is perfect for slickin' down your hair

And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain
The moon's the color of a coffee stain
Jesse Frank and Birdy Joe Hoaks
But who is the king of all these folks?

And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

Well I dined last night with Scarface Ron
On telapia fish cakes and fried black swan
Razorweed onion and peacock squirell
And I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl

And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

Well, god's green hair is where I slept last
He balanced a diamond on a blade of grass
Now I woke me up with a cardinal bird
And when I wanna talk he hangs on every word

And I'm lost, and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

== Lucinda

[verse]
____
Well, they call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long I'll be dead

Now, her hair was as black as a bucket of tar
Her skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
Now I'll never see heaven or home

I made a wish on a sliver of moonlight
A sly grin and a bowl full of stars
Like a kid who captures a firefly
And leaves it only to die in the jar

As I kick at the clouds at my hanging
As I swing out over the crowd
I will search every face for Lucinda's
And she will go off with me down to hell

I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I cast this burden on the god that's within me
And I'll leave this old world and go free

The devil dances inside empty pockets
But she never wanted money or pearls
No, that wasn't enough for Lucinda
She wasn't that kind of girl

Now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda
Whoever thought that hell be'd so low
I did well for an old tin can sailor
But she wanted the bell in my soul

I've spoken the god on the mountain
And I've swam in the Irish sea
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges
And I'll beg there for mercy for me

I thought I'd broke loose from Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I was standing outside the Whitehorse
Oh but I was afraid to go in

I heard someone pull the trigger
Her breasts heaved in the moonlight again
There was a smear of gold in the window
And then I was the jewel of her sin

They call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long I'll be dead

Now her hair was a black as a bucket of tar
Skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
I know I'll never see heaven or home
I know I'll never see heaven or home
I know I'll never see heaven or home

== Road To Peace

[verse]
____
Young Abdel Mahdi (Shahmay) was only 18 years old,
He was the youngest of nine children, never spent a night away from home.
And his mother held his photograph, opening the New York Times
To see the killing has intensified along the road to peace

There was a tall, thin boy with a whispy moustache disguised as an orthodox Jew
On a crowded bus in Jerusalem, some had survived World War Two
And the thunderous explosion blew out windows 200 yards away
With more retribution and seventeen dead along the road to peace

Now at King George Ave and Jaffa Road passengers boarded bus 14a
In the aisle next to the driver Abdel Mahdi (Shahmay)
And the last thing that he said on earth is "God is great and God is good"
And he blew them all to kingdom come upon the road to peace

Now in response to this another kiss of death was visited upon
Yasser Taha, Israel says is an Hamas senior militant
And Israel sent four choppers in, flames engulfed, tears wide open
And it killed his wife and his three year old child leaving only blackened skeletons

It's found his toddlers bottle and a pair of small shoes and they waved them in front of the cameras
But Israel says they did not know that his wife and child were in the car
There are roadblocks everywhere and only suffering on TV
Neither side will ever give up their smallest right along the road to peace

Israel launched it's latest campaign against Hamas on Tuesday
Two days later Hamas shot back and killed five Israeli soldiers
So thousands dead and wounded on both sides most of them middle eastern civilians
They fill the children full of hate to fight an old man's war and die upon the road to peace

"And this is our land we will fight with all our force" say the Palastinians and the Jews
Each side will cut off the hand of anyone who tries to stop the resistance
If the right eye offends thee then you must pluck it out
And Mahmoud Abbas said Sharon had been lost out along the road to peace

Once Kissinger said "we have no friends, America only has interests"
Now our president wants to be seen as a hero and he's hungry for re-election
But Bush is reluctant to risk his future in the fear of his political failures
So he plays chess at his desk and poses for the press 10,000 miles from the road to peace

In the video that they found at the home of Abdel Mahdi (Shahmay)
He held a Kalashnikov rifle and he spoke with a voice like a boy
He was an excellent student, he studied so hard, it was as if he had a future
He told his mother that he had a test that day out along the road to peace

The fundamentalist killing on both sides is standing in the path of peace
But tell me why are we arming the Israeli army with guns and tanks and bullets?
And if God is great and God is good why can't he change the hearts of men?
Well maybe God himself is lost and needs help
Maybe God himself he needs all of our help
Maybe God himself is lost and needs help
He's out upon the road to peace

Well maybe God himself is lost and needs help
Maybe God himself he needs all of our help
And he's lost upon the road to peace
And he's lost upon the road to peace
Out upon the road to peace.

== All The Time

[verse]
____
You're the tree that you can't eat the fruit from
I heard horses came to ride me away
I want shade and a good place to shoot from
If it's a clock I'd be the end of the day
You know you're not the boss of me
You can lift your skirt, you can shake your hair
But I got all the time in the world

You're the ditch in the road where wheels keep spinning
You're the same dead cat, clawing its way back grinning
You know, you got a bad reputation and your nine lives way down the line
I got a jacket to put on and a hat to wear
I wouldn't waste a gallon on you out there
And I got all the time in the world

A bridge is only there for you to jump off of
And there ain't no rain clouds that are blue
I do declare my independence baby
I shot off all my fireworks for you
The river's burning and the trees are on fire
There's lots of good rubber left on these tires
And I've got all the time in the world

Baby, you're the light that won't change, that I got stuck at
You're the fan that won't work at the motel
They were all out of red so I got me a blue one
Baby, you're always using mine, why don't you get you one
I know you won't go very far, you left your blonde wig in the car
And I got all the time in the world

Dot King was whittled from the bone of Cain
With a little drop of poison in the red red blood

I want to look in the mirror see another face
I said, "never", but I'm doing it again
I wanna walk away, start over again

No more rain, no more roses
On my way, shake my thirst in a cool cool pond

There's a winner in every place
There's a heart that's beating in every page
The beginning of it starts at the end
When it's time to walk away and start over again

Weather's murder at a hundred and three
William Ray shot Corabell Lee
A yellow dog knows when he has sinned
You wanna walk away and start over again

No more rain, no more roses
On my way, shaking my thirst in a cool cool pond

Cooper told Maui the whole block's gone
They're dying for jewelry, money, and clothes
I always get out of the trouble I'm in
I want to walk away, start over again

I left my bible by the side of the road
Carve my initials in an old dead tree
I'm going away but I'm going to be back when
It's time to walk away and start over again

Ho ho yeah, hmm, yeah
Gotta walk away, gotta walk away, gotta walk away
Just wanna walk away yeah, wanna walk away and start over again
Wanna walk away, wanna walk away, wanna walk away
