== What Keeps Mankind Alive

[verse]
____
You gentlemen who think you have a mission
To purge us of the seven deadly sins
Should first sort out the basic food position
Then start your preaching, that's where it begins

You lot who preach restraint and watch your waist as well
Should learn, for once, the way the world is run
However much you twist or whatever lies that you tell
Food is the first thing, morals follow on

So first make sure that those who are now starving
Get proper helpings when we all start carving
What keeps mankind alive?

What keeps mankind alive?
The fact that millions are daily tortured
Stifled, punished, silenced and oppressed
Mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance
In keeping its humanity repressed
And for once you must try not to shriek the facts
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts

== Children's Story

[verse]
____
Once upon a time there was a poor child,
with no father and no mother
And everything was dead
And no one was left in the whole world
Everything was dead

And the child went on search, day and night
And since nobody was left on the earth,
he wanted to go up into the heavens
And the moon was looking at him so friendly
And when he finally got to the moon,
the moon was a piece of rotten wood

And then he went to the sun
And when he got there, the sun was a wilted sunflower
And when he got to the stars, they were little golden flies.
Stuck up there, like the shrike sticks 'em on a blackthorn

And when he wanted to go back, down to earth,
the earth was an overturned piss pot
And he was all alone, and he sat down and he cried
And he is there till this day
All alone:

Okay, there's your story!
Night-night!

== Heigh Ho! 
(The Dwarfs' Marching Song)

[verse]
____
Well, we dig dig dig
Well, we dig in our mine the whole day through
Dig dig dig, that is what we like to do
And it ain't no trick to get rich quick
If you dig dig dig, with a shovel and a pick
Dig dig dig, the whole day through
Got to dig dig dig, it's what we like to do in our mine, in our mine
Where a million diamonds shine
We got to dig dig dig, from the morning till the night
Dig dig dig up everything in sight
We got to dig dig dig, in our mine, in our mine
Dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies, sometimes more
But we don't know what we are diggin' for, yeah

Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
We keep on singing all day long
Heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Got to make your troubles go
Well, you keep on singing all day long
Heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

== Army Ants

The Whirligig Beetles are wary and fast with an organ to detect the ripples.
The Arachnid Moths lay their eggs inside other insects along the borders of fields or roads in clusters of white cocoons.
The Ribbed Pine Borer is a longhorn beetle, their antenna's are half the length of their body and they feed on dead red pine.
Robber Flies, with their immobile heads, inject a paralyzing fluid into their prey that they snatch from life in mid-air.
The Snow Flea's mode of locomotion, strange and odd, with a spiny tail mechanism with hooks and a protracted tube from the abdomen to enable moisture absorption.

The female Praying Mantis devours the male while they are mating.
The male sometimes continues copulating even after the female has bitten off his head and part of his upper torso.
Every night wasps bite into the stem of a plant, lock their mandibles into position, stretch out at right angles to the stem and, with legs dangling, they fall asleep.

If one places a minute amount of liquor on a scorpion, it will instantly go mad and sting itself to death.
The Bombardier Beetle, when disturbed, defends itself by emitting a series of explosions, sometimes setting off 4 or 5 reports in succession.
The noises sound like miniature popgun blasts and are accompanied by a cloud of reddish coloured vile smelling fluid.
It is commonly known that ants keep slaves.
Certain species, the so-called Sanguinary Ants in particular, will raid the nests of other ant tribes and kill the queen and then kidnap many of the workers.
The workers are brought back to the captor's hive where they are coerced into performing menial tasks.

And as we discussed last semester, the Army Ants will leave nothing but your bones.
Perhaps you've encountered some of these insects in your communities, displaying both their predatory and defense characteristics, while imbedded within the walls of flesh and passing for, what is most commonly recognized... as human.

== Books Of Moses

[verse]
____
Books of Moses, bringing stone news
Wet in the water, weeping in the sun
Books of Moses, got some splinters didn't you

Books of Moses, myth and truth
Books of Moses, bring me back to you

And I'll be true to my love
if my love will be true to me

== First Kiss

[verse]
____
She drove a big ol' Lincoln with suicide doors
And a sewing machine in the back
And a light bulb that looked like an alligator egg
Was mounted up front on the hood

And she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed by Tennessee Ernie Ford
And she always had saw dust in her hair
And she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
That were covered with feathers and electrical tape
And when she got good and drunk
She would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
Where the wind is strong and folks mind their own business

And she had at least a hundred old baseballs that she'd taken from kids
And she collected bones of all kinds
And she lived in a trailer under a bridge
And she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
And she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
And she hated the mention of rain

And she made up her own language
And she wore rubber boots
And she could fix anything with string
And her lips were like cherries
And she was stronger than any man
And she smelled like gasoline and Rootbeer Fizz
And she put mud on a bee sting I got at the creek
And she gave me my very first kiss
And she gave me my very first kiss

Talking 'bout my little Kathleen
She's just a fine young thing
Someday she'll wear my ring
My little Kathleen
____

== Dog Door

[verse]
____
Oh mother I want a dog
I want a little dog
I saw a little dog
His name is happy

Well this is me ...
... old ...
I could be a shopkeeper
We'll call 'em ...

She got a six foot pitchfork
I see the wrecking-ball
Back over here together
She got me here with or without

She got me coming through the dog door
She got me coming through the dog door

I said pitchfork
Oh step-ladders

You oughta walk away
But you can't ...
... stairs
She got me gone back here
But don't sit there
She let me keep the deck-chair

She got me coming through the dog door
She got me coming through the dog door

Pitchfork (pitchfork)
Crowbar (crowbar)
Clawhammer (clawhammer)
Hot tar (hot tar)

She got me through her middle name
But she can make it rain
She got a small-town chill
And she's starving in the belly wheel

She got me coming through the dog door
She got me coming through the dog door

Pitchfork (pitchfork)
Crowbar (crowbar)
Clawhammer (clawhammer)
Hot tar (hot tar)

== Nirvana

[verse]
____
Not much chance, completely cut loose from purpose,
he was a young man riding a bus through North Carolina on the way to somewhere.
And it began to snow.

And the bus stopped at a little cafe in the hills and the passengers entered.
And he sat at the counter with the others, and he ordered, the food arrived.
And the meal was particularly good.
And the coffee.

The waitress was unlike the women he had known.
She was unaffected, and there was a natural humor which came from her.
And the fry cook said crazy things.
And the dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh.

And the young man watched the snow through the window.
And he wanted to stay in that cafe forever.
The curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there.
And it would always stay beautiful there.

And then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board.
And the young man thought: "I'll just stay here, I'll just stay here."
And then he rose and he followed the others into the bus.
He found his seat and looked at the cafe through the window.
And then the bus moved off, down a curve, downward, out of the hills.

And the young man looked straight forward.
And he heard the other passengers speaking of other things,
or they were reading or trying to sleep.
And they hadn't noticed the magic.
And the young man put his head to one side,
closed his eyes, and pretended to sleep.

There was nothing else to do,
just to listen to the sound of the engine,
and the sound of the tires
in the snow.

Poor little lamb now his fleece is all cold
Wakes up in the morning alone
Poor little lamb knows what's coming
Life is an empty cup

Poor little lamb watch your shoulder
Coyote's waiting out there
Nobody will get any older

So let's go on a bummer this summer
Where we won't have to be afraid
The world will be on a hummer, boys
And we'll laugh and we'll drink lemonade

== Altar Boy

[verse]
____
He's an ol' altar boy
Lying out there in the street
He's an ol' alter boy
Bound up in leather and chains
That's why I'm feeling so blue
I'm an old altar boy
What about you?

Now, I can order in Latin
Make 'em au gratin, Joe
I'm an old altar boy
That's why I'm so depressed
I never got the rest of the dream
Just the ritual
Now I'm habitual
Majoring in crimes that are unspeakable
Cause I'm an old altar boy
That's what happened to me.

I'm an old altar boy
He's hoping he can meet a woman dressed like a nun
He knows there's got to be some around here
Drinking across from the church
A little Father Cribari wine
On a Sunday morn' time.

I'm an old altar boy.
Why is he winking at this time in his life?
He never took a wife, cause he's an old altar boy
Oh, yeah...
What about you?

== Spidey's Wild Ride

[verse]
____
The smoke from the battle fish and the rain soaked through
and the wheelman left the shore
and barns tumbled and silos flew across fifteen miles bad road tar
And big Bull Trometer hung on to the side
and the pig dogs trembled on Spidey's wild ride

And big John Jizom from downtown Chizom
flew away with old mrs. Storm
And they found Bird Lundy neath a keg of nails crooked as a dog's hind leg
Keeping warm after twenty-nine days on hard assed bread
he drilled to the big outside and clung like a tick to his waterfront
life mooned and clouded, blued and skied
And all the clocks blew up on Spidey's wild ride

And the hills stood up in a great big 3
and left me whipped by the forces that were inside me
Loud as the ocean, cold as a desk, red as the water on the river of flesh
And he was sewing up his pants while he was shoeing a mule
And he was bucking a head wind gale
But the crooked ass beauty was trapped to the side
and he shook on Spidey's wild ride

And all the statue ass makers, and the uprooted trees
And I shouted way up to where the rabbit digs his hole
and the wheelman, the jockeys the landlords and thee
were bucking a head wind south
and with nine lives spent, he landed on his rent
composed with a steele head salmon in his mouth
and I never did see another day outside
cause I'd had enough travel on Spidey's wild ride 
____

== King Kong

[verse]
____
They shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the King

They came to his island
And they brought her with them
They wanted to get his picture
But they were surprised by his enormous size

And when he saw the woman
He took her without question
Because after all
He was the King

And he loved the woman
He loved the way she looked
And she wouldn't stop screaming

But he loved the woman
And he fought a Tyrannosaurus Rex
And it was a bloody battle
But he fought it for his woman

And he climbed up a mountain
And he looked around
Some kind of forest
With all these dinosaurs

And he stripped his woman
He stripped her bare
But there was a pterodactyl
There!

And then a hero
Came and took his woman
And they fell off the mountain
Into some water

And then later
He came looking for his woman
But they were waiting
And they threw a bomb

And they tied him
And took him across the ocean
And they chained him
And put him in the show

And when he saw his woman
He broke loose
And everyone fled in terror
And he was looking for her

And he overtook a train
And he was looking in the street
And then he found her in her apartment

And he climbed up the Empire State building
It was like a phallic symbol
And he took his woman
To the top of that towering temple

And he climbed up and looked around
Some kind of city
With all those skyscrapers
And all the cars

Just him and his screaming woman
And they were finally alone
He loved his woman
You could see it in his eyes
His great big eyes

He loved his woman
From the moment that he saw her
He was all choked up inside

But when the airplanes came
He was soon to die
But he hung on long enough to set his woman down
And make sure that she was safe

And as the bullets pierced
He looked at her so sincere
Before he fell
Because he loved his woman

And they shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the King

Who killed the monkey
'Twas beauty that killed the beast

And Willis O'Brien died
A tragic death
There wasn't much
That he had left

And Ray Harryhousen said
That when Willis died
That's when the King was really dead

They shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the King

== Dog Treat

[verse]
____
Thanks, uh... You know uh, this is weird uh...
Most of us have dogs, allright? [applause]
I don't know if it's a local thing where I live, or if it's everywhere, and I'm checking it with you because uh, I don't get in the area that often and I'm just checking to see if...
There's a new kind of a dog treat. And uh (where I live) and they're available in the pet store and for the longest time I just thought that it was some kind of a prank. Or uh...
I wasn't really sure what it was, until I read the label on the back and it said "Bull Penis" [laughter]
I was a little shocked! I know you can get just about ANYTHING in this world.
You can get a whale's pancreas if you'd want one! I can get you one! [laughter]
But com'on, a bull's penis! How busy they were their whole lives.
And they throw it to a dog, like that, for a snack! [laughter]
Now, are they available here in the Los Angeles area? They are, aren't they?
Doesn't that make you a little weazy?
Makes you wanna live a long time.
And on the back, on the bottom it said: "100% natural"!
I mean... that's the part that really got me. And it said: "A Real Meat Snack".
There's just no dignity in that. Uh, anyway...
The other thing is that they're 36 inches long! [laughter]
They're so long they had to cut them into bite-size portions.
And then they take two of them and braid them together.
I know, I know! I never want it done. But uh...
This is a song written for Gregory Peck for his dating my mom...
That's a lie!

== Missing My Son

[verse]

And uh... there's a gal in front of me that is uh.. well, she's staring at me and I'm getting a little nervous and uh, she continues to stare at me. And I uh, I keep looking the other way. And then, finally she comes over closer to me and she says: "I apologize for staring, that must have been annoying. I, I... You look so much like my son, who died. I just can't take my eyes off you." And she precedes to go into her purse and she pulls out a photograph of her son who'd died. And uh, he looks absolutely nothing like me. In fact he's... Chinese. Uh... anyway, we chatted a little bit. And uh, she says: "I'm sorry, I have to ask you. Would you mind, as I leave the supermarket here, would you mind saying "Goodbye mom" to me? I, I know it's a strange request but I haven't heard my son saying "Goodbye mom" to me, and "So long" and it would mean so much to me to hear it. And uh, if you don't mind I... " And I said: "Well, you know, okay, yeah, sure. Eh.. uh... I can say that." And, and so, she uh gets her groceries all checked out. And uh, as she's going out the door she waves at me and she hollers across the store: "Goodbye son!" And I look up and I wave and I say: "Goodbye mom!" And then she goes, and uh... So I get my few things there, on the conveyor belt and the checker checks out my things. And uh, and he gives me the total and he says: "That'll be four hundred and seventy nine dollars." Uh... and I said: "Well, how is that possible! I've only got a little tuna fish, and uh some skimmed milk, and uh mustard and a loaf of bread..." He goes: "Well, well you're also paying for the groceries for your mother. She uh, told me you'd take care of the bill for her." And I said: "Well, wait a minute! That's not my mother!" And he says: "Well I distinctly heard her say as she left the store "Bye son!" and you said "Bye mom!" and so what are you trying to say here, uh..." I said: "Well, JESUS!" And I looked out into the parking lot and she was just getting into her car. And I ran out there. And she was just closing the door, and she had a little bit of her leg sticking out of the door and she was pulling away and I grabbed her leg and I started PULLING it! Just the way... I'm pulling yours...
