== She's My Baby

[verse]
____
She's got her pudding in the oven
And it's gonna be good
She better not leave me
And go out to Hollywood
She got the best pudding in the neighborhood

She's my baby
She can drive a truck
She can drive a train (my baby, ma-ma my baby)
She can even drive an aeroplane
She's so good to look at in the rain
She's my baby

She's comin' down the sidewalk
She's stumblin through the door
She's coming home from places she's never been before
She sits down on the sofa
She poors herself a drink
Says, "Honey, honey, honey ain't no time to think"

My baby
My baby

[guitar solo]

My baby

She's got a body for business
Got a head for sin
She knocks me over like a bowling pin
She came home last night and said,
"Honey, honey, honey it's hard to get ahead."

My baby
My baby

She can build a boat
She can make it float (my baby, ma-ma my baby)
She can play my guitar
Note for note
She likes to stick her tongue right down my throat
She's my baby

My baby
My baby
My baby [repeat and fade]

== Inside Out

[verse]
____
Look out your window
That grass ain't green
It's kinda yellow
See what I mean?

Look up your chimney
The sky ain't blue
It's kinda yellow
You know it's true

(It's so hard to figure what it's all about)
When your outsides in (inside out)
And your downsides up (upside down)
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)
Yeah, don't it make you wanna twist and shout
When you're inside out

Look down your drain pipe
What color do you see?
It's got to be yellow
Don't try to fool me

(And don't it make you wanna twist and shout)
When your outsides in (inside out)
And your downsides up (upside down)
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)
Yeah, don't it make you wanna twist and shout
When you're inside out

Be careful where you're walking
You might step in something rough
Be careful where you're talking
And saying all that stuff

Take care when you are breathing
Something's funny in the air
And somethings I'm not saying
'bout what's happening out there
It's inside out

Look into the future
With your mystic crystal ball
See if it ain't yellow
See if it's there at all

(Ain't no shadow or a doubt)
(Don't it make you wanna twist and shout)
When your outsides in (inside out)
And your downsides up (upside down)
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)
Yeah, don't it make you wanna twist and shout
When you're inside out
(Inside out)
(Right side up)
Yeah, don't it make you wanna twist and shout
When you're inside out

(Inside out)
(Inside out)

== If You Belonged To Me

[verse]
____
Waltzing round the room tonight
In someone else's clothes
You're always coming out of things
Smelling like a rose
You hang your head and your heart is filled with so much misery
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me

You say let's go to the rodeo
And see some cowboy fall
Sometimes it seems to me you've
Got no sympathy at all
You keep on going on and on about how you're so free
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me

It ain't easy to get to you
But there must be some kind of a way
If only two could look to you
For only one moment of each day

You're saying that you're all washed up
Got nothing else to give
Seems like you never figured out
How long you have to live
You could feel like a baby again sitting on your daddy's knee
Oh how happy you would be
If you belonged to me

The guy your with is a ruthless pimp
Everybody knows
Every cent he takes from you
Goes straight up his nose
You look so sad, you're going so mad, any fool can see
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me

You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me
____

== The Devil's Been Busy

[verse]
____
While you're strolling down the fairway
Showing no remorse
Glowing from the poisons
They've sprayed on your golf course
While you're busy sinking birdies
And keeping your scorecard
The devil's been busy in your back yard

Steaming down the highway
With your trucks of toxic waste
Where you gonna hide it
In the outer space?
You don't know what you're doing
Or what you have to guard
The devil's been busy in your back yard

Sometimes you think you're crazy
But you know you're only mad
Sometimes you're better off not knowing
How much you've been had

You see your second cousin
Wasted in a fight
You say he had it coming
You couldn't do it right
You're in a western movie, playing the part
The devil's been busy in your back yard

Sometimes they say you're wicked
But you know that can't be bad
Sometimes you're better off not knowing
It'll only make you sad

They're coming down Picadilly
Dripping at the dash
Wasting sticky Willy
Covering him with their cash
They just might not have noticed, they've been beating him so hard
And the devil's been busy in your back yard

Devil's been busy in your back yard
Devil's been busy in your back yard
____

== 7 Deadly Sins

[verse]
____
Seven, seven, seven--deadly sins
That's how the world begins
Watch out when you step in
For seven deadly sins
Seven deadly sins
That's when the fun begins
(Seven deadly sins)

(Sin number one) was when you left me
(Sin number two) you said goodbye
(Sin number three) was when you told me a little white lie

Seven deadly sins
Once it starts, it never ends (seven deadly sins)
Watch out around the bend (seven deadly sins)
A seven deadly sins (seven deadly sins)

(Sin number four) was when you looked my way
(Sin number five) was when you smiled
(Sin number six) was when you let me stay
Sin number seven was when you touched me and told me why

Seven deadly sins
So many rules to bend
Time and time again
Seven deadly sins
Seven deadly sins

(Seven deadly sins)
(Seven deadly sins)
(Seven deadly sins)

Seven deadly sins
That's how the world begins (seven deadly sins)
Watch out when you step in (seven deadly sins)
For seven deadly sins
Seven (seven) seven (seven) seven (seven) seven (deadly sins)

== Poor House

[verse]
____
You walk in, half past nine
Lookin' like a queen
Serving me with papers
Calling me obscene
Woman I've tried so hard
Just to do my best
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And you'll take all the rest

Up all day, down all night
Working on the job
Everything I do is wrong
I always end up right
Woman I try so hard
Done all I can do
They're gonna put me in the poor house
Keep all the best for you.

Ooh, in the poor house
Ooh, in the poor house

If a drove a pulpwood truck
Would you love me more?
Will you bring me diamonds
And hang around my door
Woman, I've done my best
They're ain't much left for me
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And throw away the key

(In the poor house)
Ooh, in the poor house

You walked in, half past nine
Lookin' like a queen
Serving me with papers
Calling me obscene
Woman I've tried so hard
Just to do my best
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And you'll take all the rest

In the poor house
Ooh, in the poor house

In the poor house
Ooh, in the poor house

== Where Were You Last Night

[verse]
____
Where were you last night?
You were so uptight
What did you do, who did you see?
Were you with someone
Who reminded you of me?

Where were you last night?

Where were you last week?
Were you up a creek?
Did you stay up pacing the floor?
Got me worried
You ignore me more and more

Where were you last night?
You weren't around me
When they found me
Where were you last night?

You'd better stop your messin' around
Your name is going round from town to town
It's making me sad
Making me feel bad
Where were you last night?

Where were you last year?
You're sure as hell weren't here
You weren't waiting where you said
You sent someone in your place instead

Where were you last night?
It's getting to me
Making me gloomy
Where were you last night? 
____

== Cool Dry Place

[verse]
____
Well I woke up this morning
The place was such a wreck
I couldn't reach the bathroom
Thought I'd better clear the deck
I tried to call the lawyer
And ask him what to do
He referred me to his doctor
Who referred me back to you
And when you checked the manual
You kept inside the case
It said 'put it in a cool dry place'

I drove around the city
Looking for a room
That was high above the water
Where my things could be in tune
There was no one to help me
Nobody even cared
I had to got through hell
To get those things up there
I paid my first subscription
Then I joined the idle race
And they said 'store it in a cool dry place'

I got guitar, basses, amplifiers and drums
Accordions and mandolins and things that sometimes hum
Cymbals and harmonicas, capos by the score
And lots of things in boxes laying all around the floor

Some places they get mildew
And others get too hot
Some places are so damp that
Everything you got just rots
All kinds of condensation
Directories of the rain
There's not much compensation
When everything's been stained
Some have sentimental value that
Cannot be erased
Go store it in a cool dry place

We got solids and acoustics
And some from plywood board
And some are trimmed in leather
And some are made with gourds
There's organs and trombones
And reverbs we can use
Lots of DX-7s
And old athletic shoes
I bought a great big building
It took up one whole block
I made an inventory
Of all the things in stock
The place was getting longer
I was up all night
I used up all my pencils
But I went onto spite
The blury of my vision
The sweat upon my face
I've got to put this stuff away
I mustn't leave a trace

The landlord's breathing down my neck
He say's it's a disgrace
So I said 'put it in a cool, dry, place.' 
____

== New Blue Moon

[verse]
____
I don't want nothing
Nothing but you
Am I waiting
Looking for a new blue moon

I'm so tired waiting
Waiting for you
Am I waiting
Looking for a new blue moon

So many moons have come and gone
And none of them were blue
So many times the sun came up but
Came up without you, you, ya yoo hoo oh

You won't call me
Call me lonely
Am I waiting
Looking for a new blue moon

So many moons have come and gone
And none of them were blue
Too many times the sun came up but it
Came up without you, you, ya yoo hoo oh

Someday when you hold me
Someday you may see
I was waiting
Looking for a new blue moon

I was waiting
Looking for a new blue moon
Blue Moon 
____

== You Took My Breath Away

[verse]
____
You took my breath away
I want it back again
Look at the mess I'm in
I don't know what to say
I don't know how to feel
You don't care anyway
All I can do is wait
You took my breath away

You took this song of mine
And changed the middle bit
It used to sound alright
But now the words don't fit
It's getting hard to rhyme
Impossible to play
I've tried it many times
You took my breath away

One day when the sun is shining
There will be that silver lining

You knocked my headlights out
So turn them on again
I can't see where I'm going
I can't tell where I've been
I don't know how to feel
This hasn't been my day
Seems like I've lost a wheel
You took my breath away

You took my breath away
You took my breath away
You took my breath away
____

== Wilbury Twist

[verse]
____
You put your hand on your head
Put your foot in the air
Then you hop around in the room
In your underwear
Ain't ever bin nothin' quite like this
Come on baby it's The Wilbury Twist

Lift your other foot up
Fall on your ass
Get back up,
Put your teeth in a glass
Ain't ever bin nothin' quite like this
It's a magical thing called The Wilbury Twist

Everybody's tryin' to do the Wilbury Twist

Roll up your rug,
Dust your broom
Ball the jack,
Howl at the moon
Ain't ever bin nothin' quite like this
Everybody's tryin' to do The Wilbury Twist

Turn your lights down low
Put your blindfold on
You'll never know
Where your friends have gone
Could be years before you're missed
Everybody's trying to do The Wilbury Twist

It's a different dance
For you all to do
Spin your body like a screw
Better not forget it on your shopping list
You can stop and buy one it's The Wilbury Twist

Ain't never bin nothin' quite like this
Eh, come and get it it's the Wilbury Twist
I guess by now you got the gist
Everybody's crazy 'bout the Wilbury Twist

== Nobody's Child

[verse]
____
As I was slowly passing, an orphans home today
I stopped for just a little while to watch the children play
A lone boy standin', and when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see, and he began to cry

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growin' wild
No mama's arms to hold me no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

In every town and village
There are places just like this
With rows and rows of children
And babies in their cribs

They've long since stopped their cryin'
As no-one ever hears
And no-one there to notice them or take away their fears

Nobody's child, they're nobody's child
Just like a flower they're growin wild
No mama's arms to hold them, no daddy's smile
Nobody wants them they're nobody's child

Nobody's child, they're nobody's child
Just like a flower they're growin wild
No mama's arms to hold them, no daddy's smile
Nobody wants them they're nobody's child
Nobody wants them they're nobody's child
