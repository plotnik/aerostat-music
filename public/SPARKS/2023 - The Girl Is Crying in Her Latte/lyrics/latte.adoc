== The Girl Is Crying In Her Latte

[verse]
____
Is it due to the rain
Or is she in some pain?
She looks physically fine
Guess it's something benign

The girl is crying in her latte, yeah
The girl is crying in her latte, sad
The girl is crying in her latte, wow
The girl is crying in her latte, bad

Now she's leaving the place
Someone's taking her place
Orders, then takes a seat
Looks like it's a repeat

The girl is crying in her latte, yeah
The girl is crying in her latte, sad
The girl is crying in her latte, wow
The girl is crying in her latte, bad

So many people are crying in their latte
So many people are crying in their latte
So many people are crying in their latte (So many people)
So many people are crying in their latte (So many people)

The girl is crying in her latte, yeah
The girl is crying in her latte, sad
The girl is crying in her latte, wow
The girl is crying in her latte, bad

Every day was the same (So many people)
Tried to figure their game (So many people)
They all ordered the same (So many people)
Guess the world is to blame (So many people)

The girl is crying in her latte, yeah
The girl is crying in her latte, sad
The girl is crying in her latte, wow
The girl is crying in her latte, bad

So many people are crying in their latte
So many people are crying in their latte
So many people are crying
in their latte (So many people)

== Veronica Lake

[verse]
____
There's a war going on, can't make a mistake
All the girls are on the line, they must stay awake
Every B-29, so much at stake
But they're working on the line, 'til they all will ache

And they all do want to be Veronica Lake
But that peek-a-booy hair, it's a big mistake
As the foreman has to yell, 'put on the brake'
Yet another girl caught, Veronica Lake

And their loverboys are gone, so much at stake
As they rivet and drill, then they take a break
Reading movie star mags, they will imitate
Yes, the one they all adore, Veronica Lake

And that peek-a-booy hair, it's a big mistake
Once again foreman yells, 'put on the brake'
As the blond wavy hair, millions partake
And they fancy themselves Veronica Lake

In the midst of a war, we all must partake
Of our fantasy world, give us all a break
And their fantasy girl who they imitate
Is their number one choice, Veronica Lake

Veronica Lake
Veronica Lake

As the leaders convene, so much is at stake
The assembly has slowed, this we cannot take
There's a problem with their hair, each day we brake
'Cause they all want to be Veronica Lake

Now the government says, 'for goodness sake
Get a hold of this girl, Veronica Lake'
And they beg her and plead, can you please make
Your hair slightly less like Veronica Lake

And you'll still get to be Veronica Lake
Just a little toned down for the Allies' sake
All the girls look to you for the path to take
But that peek-a-booy hair, way too many breaks

She accepts their advice, hair now put in place
Not all swerving on down on her pretty face
She will kill her career all for the sake
Of our winning the war, Veronica Lake

Yes she killed her career, so much at stake
But we're winning the war, now we've caught a break
Still a casualty of war, Veronica Lake
As Veronica Lake's not Veronica Lake

She is still a pretty girl, make no mistake
But she isn't like before, how my heart aches
Back then no one would mistake Veronica Lake
For any other girl, Veronica Lake
____

== Nothing Is as Good as They Say It Is

[verse]
____
Nothing is as good as they say it is
That's the way it is
I wish I'd known beforehand
I was born just 22 hours ago
But I want to go
Back to my former quarters

Mama, Mama!
Can you accommodate
Mama, Mama!
Tell me I'm not too late
Mama, Mama!
Can you cooperate
This will not work, I'm sure

Nothing is as good as they say it is
And I'd be remiss
If I weren't honest with you
This is not a place that I can exist
Not ungratefulness
I just don't want this, want this

Mama, Mama!
Is there a remedy?
Can I just go back where I used to be?
I was happy where I was previously
Just floating there, stood tall
Mama, Mama please sympathize
This has been such a bad surprise
I won't ask any more from you
I can live with a lousy view

Nothing is as good as they say it is
That's the way it is
I wish I'd known beforehand
I was born just 22 hours ago
But I've seen enough
To make a wise decision
All your standards must be so very low
This is not a place that I'd want to go
How can you exist in a place like this
I surely can't, oh no!

Take a look around and you'd understand
This is not a place I could ever stand
Ugliness, anxiety, phony tans
It ain't for me, that's all!

Thank you both for this special chance
Were I born in the south of France
I would feel less resistant to
Somewhere that just deserves
Adieu!

Nothing is as good as they say it is
That's the way it is
I wish I'd known beforehand
Nothing is as good as they say it is
That's the way it is
I wish I'd known beforehand
All your standards must be so very low
This is not a place that I'd want to go
How can you exist in a place like this
I surely can't, oh no!

Nothing is as goo
d as they say it is
Nothing is as good as they say it is

== The Mona Lisa's Packing, Leaving Late Tonight

[verse]
____
She might seem dispassionate, but that's not true
She feels much the same as everyone, me and you
But the current atmosphere has proved too much for her
And she's making a decision, do what's right for her

No one knew she was so disturbed
No one knew, she seemed imperturbed
No one knew she was so uptight
The Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight

All the world is agitated, ill at ease
But she always felt she'd rise above all maladies
But it's not become impossible for her to smile
So she's gonna pack a credit card and rack up miles

No one knew she was so disturbed
No one knew, she seemed imperturbed
No one knew she was so uptight
The Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight

I had no idea she could mask her fear
This is one surprise
I can sympathize

No one knew she was so disturbed
No one knew, she seemed imperturbed
No one knew she was so uptight
The Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight

No one knew she was so disturbed
No one knew, she seemed imperturbed
No one knew she was so uptight
The Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight

Where's she going, I can only take a guess
I imagine some old island somewhere, decompress
Where she's far away from all the pain and misery
Hope the island sun don't fade her priceless imagery

No one knew she was so disturbed
No one knew, she seemed imperturbed
No one knew she was so uptight
The Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight

I had no idea she could mask her fear
This is one surprise
I can sympathize

No one knew she was so disturbed
No one knew, she seemed imperturbed
No one knew she was so uptight
The Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight

La la la, la la la, la la la
The
Mona Lisa's packing, leaving late tonight
____

== You Were Meant for Me

[verse]
____
I can plainly see that you were meant for me
That you were meant for me tonight
I don't see the point not getting to the point
That you were meant for me tonight

Who comes after me had better, better be
A perfect specimen of man
At the Monoprix you stood out so to me
I asked you out and you said no

Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, how does it all end?

Then your sweater caught my shopping cart
And you declared it must be due to fate
Now I plainly see is what you said to me
That you were meant for me tonight

Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, how does it all end?

Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, how does it all end?

Talk of moons and stars are pickup lines at bars
Why would I need that talk tonight?
You can clearly see that you've got sway with me
And you were meant for me tonight

I can clearly see that you were meant for me
And you were meant for me tonight
I can clearly see that you were meant for me
And you were meant for me tonight

Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, how does this all end?

Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn the pages, turn the pages
Turn t
he pages, how does this all end?
____

== Not That Well-Defined

[verse]
____
Things are either black or they are white
Things are either wrong or they are right
Things are either good or they are bad
Things are either happy or they're sad

Can a person say that they exist
When so far they managed to resist
Any definition, any key
You are like a fog dealt from the sea
I'm at a loss

Because you're not that well-defined
A sketch where someone's erased the lines
I'd say that you're not that well-defined
A photograph after too much wine

I can picture actors I don't know
I can picture athletes and the pope
And the guy who lives just down the hall
But I can't imagine you at all
I'm at a loss

Because you're not that well-defined
A sketch where someone's erased the lines
I'd say that you're not that well-defined
A photograph after too much wine

While you're posing there with Claude Monet
As he finished you he'd proudly say
Now, that is art

Because you're not that well-defined
You're like a contract returned unsigned
I'd say that you're not that well-defined
You're like a contract that's left unsigned

Things are either black or they are white
Things are either wrong or they are right
I'm at a loss
____

== We Go Dancing

[verse]
____
Who says we don't have our fun above the DMZ
We assemble daily and we dance incessantly
And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Pyongyang is a-rockin', missiles driving through the square
We go dancing proudly, legs are kicking in the air
And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

We have got the greatest DJ in the whole wide world
Kim Jong Un is what they call him
Man, he rocks our world
As we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Skrillex, maybe Diplo, they've got nothing on our dude
Look at how the crowd is grooving, he is one bad dude
And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Dance!
Dance!

And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Dance!
Dance!

And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Chicks are together and all of them pack a gun
Fashion the latest and watch as they move as one
And they are dancing, dancing
They are dancing, dancing

I got a baby who kills it in olive drab
She is what decadent Westerners might call "fab"
As she goes dancing, dancing
She goes dancing, dancing

We don't have a lot of moves, but our one move is tight
We don't need no YouTube, Kim Jong Un don't like their vibe
And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Sometimes I get injured, man, it's harder than it looks
I just plow on through it, I don't want no angry looks
And I go dancing, dancing
I go dancing, dancing

No one in the world is dancing near as good as we
No one has the discipline, the choreography
And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing

Dance!
Dance!
Dance!

And we go dancing, dancing
We go dancing, dancing
Dance!

== When You Leave

[verse]
____
They'll be breaking out the hard stuff when you leave
They'll be breaking out the chit chat when you leave
They'll be breaking out the making out when you leave

They can't wait, they can't wait

They'll be breaking out the X-Box when you leave
They'll be breaking out the Courvoisier when you leave
They'll be breaking out every Belgian beer when you leave

They can't wait, they can't wait

I'm gonna stay just to annoy them
I'm gonna stay just to piss them off
I'm gonna stay just to amuse myself
I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna stay

They'll be breaking out the good music when you leave
The Stylistics, The Spinners, The Delfonics
And they'll keep on, keep on making out when you leave

They can't wait, they can't wait

There'll be red wine on all the carpets when you leave
There'll be salsa on all the carpets when you leave
There'll be God knows what other liquids when you leave

They can't wait, they can't wait

I'm gonna stay just to annoy them
I'm gonna stay just to toy with them
I'm gonna stay, they can't push me around
I'm gonna stay, stay all the way

They'll be talking behind your back when you leave
How you couldn't take the hint and just leave
They invited you then regretted it, he won't leave
Big mistake, big mistake

They can't wait, they can't wait
They can't wait, they can't wait
They can't wait, they can't wait
They can't wait, they can't wait

They'll be swinging from the chandeliers when you leave
They'll be putting on Mickey Mouse ears when you leave
While they act out scenes from King Lear when you leave
There goes one of the chandeliers when you leave

I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna stay
I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna stay
I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna stay
(They'll be breaking out the making out when you leave)
I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna stay
(They'll be brea
king out the making out when you leave)

== Take Me for a Ride

[verse]
____
Take me, take me, take me, take me, take me for a ride, ride
I don't know a thing about you, but I need a ride
Yes, I am a fugitive, but still I'm on your side, side
But they'll never ever take me, take this boy alive

Take me, take me, take me, take me, take me for a ride, ride
Why, I wonder, did you stop and offer me a ride?
You have got one heavy foot, we're going ninety-five, five
You seem like a girl in need of thrills to stay alive

With your Chevy Powerglide
You don't have to shift to keep the lawmen far behind
With your Chevy Powerglide
We don't have to stop, no time

So, take me, take me, take me, take me, take me for a ride, ride
Let's avoid all areas that seem too gentrified
When you're hungry, we can stop, I just eat food that's fried, fried
My name's Johnny, what's your name? You seem so dignified

With your Chevy Powerglide
We don't have to stop and hide

So take me, take me, take me, take me, take me for a ride, ride
I don't know a thing about you, but I need a ride

Let's go, let's go Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Faster, faster Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Faster, faster Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura

Roadblock dead ahead, we've got to crash it, drive, girl, drive
They will never, never take this boy alive, alive
Now you're an accomplice, and I'm sorry, but that's life, girl
Floor it, floor it, floor it, we've now hit a hundred five

With your Chevy Powerglide
You don't have to shift to keep the lawmen far behind
With your Chevy Powerglide
We don't have to stop, no time

So they repeat this ritual each Friday night at nine
He is an accountant and she teaches kids design
Once a week, they live a moment that makes them alive
Fighting off the tedium of both their daily lives

Let's go, let's go Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Faster, faster Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura
Faster, faster Laura
Let's go, let's go Laura

Take me, take me, take me, take me, take me for a ride, ride
I don't know a thing about you, but I need a ride
Yes, I am a fugitive, but still I'm on your side, ride
But they'll never ever take me, take this boy alive

Hey, one of them's new
Whatever is fine

== It Doesn't Have To Be That Way

[verse]
____
They always said that you cannot change your mind
Do it once and you're defined, do it twice and you're divine
It doesn't have to be that way, okay?

They always said that you need to have a plan
Doesn't matter, any plan, any plan they'll understand
It doesn't have to be that way, okay?

I may be wrong, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
No chart-bound song, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
No sing along, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it

They always said you must stay between the lines
Be easily defined or you're wasting all your time
It doesn't have to be that way, okay?

They always said that it has to be refined
Or you'll leave someone behind, all the pages must be lined
It doesn't have to be that way, okay?

I may be wrong, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
No chart-bound song, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
No sing along, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it

I'll look uncool, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll look the fool, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll look too schooled, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it

They always said that it must reflect your life
And incorporate your strife, maybe mentioning your wife
It doesn't have to be that way, okay?

I may be wrong, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
No chart-bound song, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
No sing along, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it

How 'bout a drink? I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
It's been too long, I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it

== Gee, That Was Fun

[verse]
____
Gee, that was fun
Being with you all this time
Being with you all this time
Gee, that was fun

Gee, that was grand
Letting me be in your plans
Finally a change, change of plans
Still it was grand

Wish I had more dumb photographs
Wish I'd recorded all your laughs
Wish I had kept your Christmas cards
Wish I'd more often washed my car
Wish I could name that bright, bright star
Wish I knew darker, cooler bars
You would pretend my choice was great
I could sense you thought "second rate"

Gee, that was great
Even when you showed up late
Every time worth the wait
Gee, that was great

Gee, if I'd known
I'd have been less on my phone
I'd have been more in the zone
If I had known

Wish I gave better compliments
Wish I loved Crime and Punishment
Should have spent less time watching sports
Should have improved my quick retorts
You were a bit too good for me
Didn't take long 'til you agreed
But I'm not bitter, it's a fact
Seeming assured was just an act of mine

Gee, that was fun
Being with you all this time
Being with you all this time
Gee, that was fun
