== Love Floats

[verse]
____
If I was your lover, I’d take you to the sky
If you are feeling low, I will make you high
Let me be your lover, baby, I will be your beau
I can take you anywhere that you wanna go.

Let's do it again, yeah.

If I was your lover, I’d take you to the sea
Drown you in kisses like you wanna be
Let me be your lover, my mermaid on the sand
We can be in ecstacy, lemme hold your hand and she said ..

Love floats in space, that space between us
Love floats in space, that space between us.

Let me come in.

Oh, Maeve, Maeve, Maeve ..

The question that you should not answer
An answer that you should not ask
And the answer is the question
And the question is the task.

As I stroll down through my madness
Without worry or warning
Dark before the depths of sadness
Breathing through the grey morning.

Tell you anything I like.

Holla ma gollo aholla
Holla ma golla aholla
Holla ma golla aholla

Deep within the silent forest, in the darkest hour of night
Gleams a gleaming so wondrous, could it be the pale moonlight?
Nay luna ne'r can enter, forests dark and deep as these
See, it is the secret Goddess wandering amidst her trees.

Holla ma gollo aholla
Holla ma golla aholla
Holla ma golla aholla
I tell you anything I like.

Gonna do all the things I never done before

Gonna do all the things I never done before
I gonna get myself together somehow.

Well, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird and she warble as she fly
And she never warble cuckoo till the fourth day of July
Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds, well I know you of old
Well, you robbed my poor pocket of the silver and the gold.

Well, the cuckoo is a pretty bird and she warbles as she fly
But she never warble cuckoo till the fourth day of July
Well, I’ve gambled in London and I’ve gambled in Spain
And I bet you, my silver saddle, that I’ll beat you next game.

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird and she warble as she fly
But she never warble cuckoo till the fourth day of July
Well, she brings us glad tidings and tells us no lies
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird and she warble as she fly.

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird and she warble as she fly
But she never warble cuckoo till the fourth day of July
Little darlin’, little darlin’, I miss you on the road
Well, you are my only darlin’, my one and only true abode.

Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird and she warble as she fly
And she never warble cuckoo till the fourth day of July.

Oh yeah, oh yeah.

== Do Not Go Gentle

[verse]
____
Do not go gentle into that good night
Old age should burn and rave at close of day
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right
Because their words had forked no lightning
They do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears
I pray, do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light
The dying of the light.
