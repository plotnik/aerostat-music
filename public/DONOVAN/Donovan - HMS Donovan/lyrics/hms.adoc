== The Walrus And The Carpenter

[verse]
____
[spoken]
Presenta the grand circo!
The prima del mondo!
La grand successo!
Giulia Nova Vittorio!
Fantastico!
Magnifico!
Spectaculario!

[spoken]
Here Alice ventured to interupt - 
"It's very long" she said as politely as she could -
"Will you tell me first which road?"
Tweedledum smiled gently and began again.

[spoken]
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might;
He did his very best to make
The billows smoothe and bright -
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.

[sung]
The moon was shining sulkily
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done.
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil all the fun."

[sung]
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud
Because no cloud was in the sky.
No birds were flying overhead
There were no birds to fly.

[spoken]
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand.
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand.
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand."

[spoken]
"If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

[spoken]
"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach.
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."

[spoken]
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said.
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head -
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster bed.

[sung]
But four young Oysters hurried up, 
All eager for their treat,
Their coats were brushed,
Their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat,
And this was odd,
Because you know they hadn't any feet.

[sung]
Four other Oysters followed them
And yet another four,
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more,
All hopping through the frothy waves
And scrambling to the shore.

[sung]
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock 
Conveniently low,
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.

[spoken]
"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things;
Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -
Of cabbages - and kings -
And why the sea is boiling hot -
And whether pigs have wings."

[sung]
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat,
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!"
"No hurry," said the Carpenter,
They thanked him much for that.

[sung]
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need,
Pepper and vinegar besides,
Are very good indeed,
Now, if you're ready oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."

[sung]
"Not on us!" the Oysters cried
Turning a little blue,
"After such kindness that would be
A dismal thing to do."

[spoken]
"The night is fine," the Walrus said,
"Do you admire the view?"

[spoken]
"It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice."
The Carpenter said nothing but,
"Cut us another slice.
I wish you were not quite so deaf -
I've had to ask you twice."

[spoken]
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick."
The Carpenter said nothing but,
"The butter's spread to thick."

[spoken]
"I weep for you," the Walrus said,
"I deeply sympathize."

[sung]
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

[spoken]
"Oh oysters" said the Carpenter,
"You've had a pleasant run -
Trotting home again?"
But answer came there none.
And this was scarcely odd
Because they'd eaten every one.
They'd eaten every one.

== Jabberwocky

[verse]
____
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought-
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

'And has thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Calloh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

== The Seller Of Stars

[verse]
____
I wish I could find a queer street,
The crooked queer street that goes
East of the sun and West of the moon
And out where no wind blows.
Then I'd find the shop where the seller of stars
Sits and hammers behind the bars.

Stars he gives for the asking,
Starlight swords for the bold.
Moon he sells for a penny or two
Rounded and bright with gold.
And broken silver of the sea he sells
And the rain spears and the wind bells.

Wings he weaves for the fairies,
Gold of the sun you can buy
And silver flowers of frost and dew,
Rainbows out of the sky.
And delicate morning mist he sells
And pretty new songs for whispering shells.

Oh, if I could find that dear street,
The darling wee street with his house.
I would buy a blackbird's whistle for you
And for Johnny a talking mouse
And a mermaid's tail to swim in the sea
And dragon-fly wings for my Mummy and me!

I wish I could find the wee street,
That wanders up and down,
That is East of the sun and West of the moon
And very near twilight town,
Where the seller of stars for a penny or two
Will sell your heart's desire to you
____

== Lost Time

[verse]
____
Timothy took his time to school
Plenty of time he took
But some he lost in the tadpole pool
And some in the stickle back brook
Ever so much in the linnets nest
And more on the five-barred gate
Timothy took his time to school
But he lost it all and was late.

Timothy has a lot to do
How shall it all be done?
Why he never got home till close on two
Though he might have been back by one
There's sums and writings and spelling too
And an apple tree to climb
Timothy has a lot to do
How shall he find the time?

Timothy sought it high and low
He looked in the tadpole pool
To see if they'd taken the time to grow
That he lost on the way to school
He found the nest and he found the tree
And he found the gate he'd crossed
But Timothy never shall find ah me
The time that Timothy lost.

Tam ta ta tam ...

Timothy sought it high and low
He looked in the tadpole pool
To see if they'd taken the time to grow
That he lost on the way to school
He found the nest and he found the tree
And he found the gate he'd crossed
But Timothy never shall find ah me
The time that Timothy lost
The time that Timothy lost
The time that Timothy lost
The time that Timothy lost ...

== The Little White Road

[verse]
____
Oh the little white road climbs over the hill
My feet they must follow, they cannot be still
Must follow and follow though far it may roam
Oh little white road, will you never come home?

Oh the hills they are patient and steadfast and wise
They look o'er the valleys and up to the skies
But the little white road scrambles up them and over
Oh little white road, you are ever the rover.

I fain would go with you right down to the sea
Where a ship with white sails would be waiting for me
Go sailing and sailing to strange lands afar
Where deserts and forests and lost cities are.

But when I grew weary of my gypsying ways
I'd sail home again for to end all my days
In the little grey cottage, beside the grey hill
But you, little road, would be wandering still.
____

== The Star

[verse]
____
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle, twinkle all the night.

The dark blue sky you keep
And often through my curtains peep
For you never shut your eye
Till the sun is in the sky
'Tis your bright and tiny spark
Lights the traveller in the dark
Though I know not what you are
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

And all on account 
Of my little nut tree

Ally bally bally bally be
Sittin' on yer mamy's knee
Greetin' for a wee baw bee
Tae buy some COULTER'S CANDY
____

== The Road

[verse]
____
Outside our little garden gate, far over hill and down
The bright road, the long white road goes winding through the town.

I often peep between the bars when I am tired of play
I wish that I could follow it some happy summer day.

... pass beneath the trees ...
____

== Things To Wear

[verse]
____
If you wear a woven ring made of grass
You can hear the fairies sing as they pass
You can hear them rush and scurry
When they're rather in a hurry.

If you wear a daisy chain, neat and strong
You can hear the goblin train rush along
You can hear it hoot and whistle
As it dives beneath a thistle.

If you lace two grassy blades in your shoe
You can dream of fairy glades, fairies too
If you've found a four-leafed clover
You can dream this four times over.

== Wynken, Blynken And Nod

[verse]
____
Wynken, Blynken and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew
"Where are you going and what do you wish?"
The old Moon asked the tree
"We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beutiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we"
Said Wynken, Blynken and Nod

The old Moon laughed and he sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew
The little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish
For never afeared are we"
So cried the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
For the fish in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home
'Twas all so prettty, a sail it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought 'twas a dream they dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trunble bed
Now close your eyes while mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock in the misty sea
As the old Moon rocked the fishermen three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod
____

== Celia Of The Seals

[verse]
____
Should you wander this land to the North,
And few seldom do,
Should you follow the song of the gull
To enchanted western isles,
Coax a fisherman to take you out
Where the silky seals are seen,
Hear the stories that they tell about
The maiden who is their queen,
The maiden who is their queen.
Celia of the seals,
She knows just how they feel,
Celia of the seals.
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
Seal hunters are not brave and bold,
They murder her poor wee seals
And cut off their skins to be sold,
Cursed be he who deals.
There's no reason for this slaughtering,
They're left on the rocks to bleed
He's not a man who does this thing,
It's a cruel and a heartless deed,
A cruel and a-heartless deed.
Celia of the seals,
She knows just how they feel,
Celia of the seals.
Celia of the seals,
Celia of the seals,
She knows just how they feel,
Celia of the seals,
Celia of the seals,
Celia of the seals,
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"
"Voyna, voyna, voyna, voyna voyna vay"

== The Voyage Of The Moon

[verse]
____
The moon is like a boat, my love
Of lemon peel afloat, my love
And with a sail of gauze, my love
She seems to slightly pause
Upon her silent way, all on her silent way.

I see her pearly decks, my love
Set in with twinkling specks, my love
I see her pearly mast, my love
Far from her seashell past
And gently does she sway, all on her starry way.

Of silk they have been spun, my love
Her ropes that limply run, my love
Down to her carved prow, my love
Down to her mermaid prow
And softly does she sway, all on her starry way.

All in the Sea of Sky, my love
The moonships sail and fly, my love
Though many are their kind, my love
Though all need but one wind
To make their starry way, to make their starry way.

And there will come a time, my love
O may it be in mine, my love
When men will proudly rise, my love
And board to sail the skies
Moonships from all the spheres, moonships from all the spheres.

The men he bathed in light, my love
The women clothed in white, my love
All in that woundrous fleet, my love
As each the other meets
Will smile and softly sing, will smile and softly sing.

And on some distant sand, my love
The ships will gently land, my love
Fair folk will meet them there, my love
With golden flowing hair
And great will be their joy, and great will be their joy.

The moon is like a boat, my love
Of lemon peel afloat, my love
And with a sail of gauze, my love
She seems to slightly pause.
____

== The Unicorn

[verse]
____
Hast thou seen the unicorn
Along the misty shore ?

He bowing down the horny horn
Strangely strung with bells,
Combing through the shingle for
The periwinkle shells
____

== Lord Of The Dance

[verse]
____
I danced in the morning when the world was begun
I danced in the Moon, and the stars, and the Sun
I came down from Heaven and I danced on Earth
At Bethlehem I had my birth.

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

I danced for the scribe and the pharisee
They would not dance, they wouldn't follow me
So I danced for the fishermen James and John
They come with me and the Dance went on:

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

I danced on the Sabbath and cured the lame
The holy people, they said it was a shame!
They whipped and stripped and then hung me high
Left me there on a cross to die!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black
It's hard to dance with the devil on your back
They buried my body and they thought I'd gone
But I am the Dance and I still go on!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

They cut me down but I leap up high
I am the Life that will never never die!
I live in you if you live in Me
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!

Dance then, wherever you may be
For I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

Dance then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He!
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said He!

Rain on a window, kettle on a stove
Where is little Ben? In the Rowan grove.

Little Ben is with me.
____

== Can Ye Dance

[verse]
____
Can ye dance with silver moonsteps on the love couch of the sand?
I will sing and play a fairy reel upon a swany lute
A tale of silver sandals or an elf who loved to fish
For the twinkles in the evening waves with an oaken dish.

As ye skip and spin and reel, can ye loose thy velvet band?
And send thy mane a-tossing to the kissing of the moon?
And as ye bid me enter, thine eyes will open love
To the allness of the smallness and the starry sky above.

Oh pa ti to cum dee...

== In An Old Fashioned Picture Book

[verse]
____
Come take a look with me in an old fashioned picture book
Patience, the girl we see on the sand with the squint and the parasol low
Sweethearts are sewn 'tween the cloth of her cuff
A shell in her little tight hand
Soon she'll be going away with her bottle of sand tomorrow
From the shores of yesterday.

Come see her move and be in our old fashioned backward look
Just like an old movie, talking and real like when it was took
Bats, balls and Tomboys, cheeky and gruff
Faint sounds of a distant brass band
Who rides the donkey today? 
Will our visions of tomorrow mingle with those of yesterday?

Come, close your eyes and hear melodies from an old music box
Tinkling as tandems and tears, go tumbling like tresses and small perfumed locks
Sweet dreams were sewn 'tween the years of her life
A tear in her little kerchief waving and fading away
With her bottled sand tomorrow from the shores of yesterday
Will her visions of tomorrow mingle with those of yesterday?

Come take a look with me in an old fashioned picture book.
____

== The Song Of The Wandering Aengus

[verse]
____
I wish out to the hazel wood
Because a fire was in my head
And I cut and peeled a hazel wand
And hooked a berry with a thread
And when white moths were on the wing
And moth-like stars were flickering out
I dropped a berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire aflame
But something rustled on the door
And someone called me by by name.
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossoms in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands
I will find out where she has gone
And kiss her lips and take her hands
And walk among long dappled grass
And pluck till time and times are done
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun
____

== A Funny Man

[verse]
____
One day a funny kind of man
Came walking down this street
He wore a shoe upon his head
And hats upon his feet,

He raised the shoe and smiled at me
His manners were polite
But never had I seen before
such a funny sounding sight

He said: «Allow me to present
Your highness with a rose»
An taking out a current bun
He held it ti his nose

Staggered back against the wall
And the I answered: «well,
I never saw a rose with such
A funny looking smell».

He the began to sing a song
Mmmmmm.....
and sat down on the ground
You never heard in all your life
Such a funny feeling sound

«My friend, why do you wear
2 hats upon your feet?» I said
He turned the other way about
And hopped on his head.

She in her boat long hours

Lost in evening twilight
two swans glide
and fly...
o'er the reedy river

She fell in love with a swan...

== Queen Mab

[verse]
____
A little fairy comes at night,
her eyes are blue and her hair is brown
With silver spots upon her wings
And from the moon she flutters down.

She has a little silver wand
And when a good child goes to bed
She waves a hand from right to the left
And makes a circle round its head.

And then it dreams of pleasant things,
Of fountains filled with fairy fish
And trees that bear delicious fruit
And bow their branches at a wish.

Of arbours filled with dainty scents,
From lovely flowers that never fade,
Bright flies that glitter in the sun
And glow-worms shining in the shade

And talking birds with gifted tongues
For singing songs and telling tales
And pretty dwarfs to show the way
Through fairy hills and fairy dales.

A little fairy comes at night,
her eyes are blue and her hair is brown
With silver spots upon her wings
And from the moon she flutters down

== La Moora

[verse]
____
We're sailing away to the sleepy lagoon
By the light of the stars, by the shine of the moon
And mermaids are singing a sweet lullaby
And kissing the babies as they sail by.

La Moora, La Moora, soft as a sigh
Kissing the babies as they sail by
La Moora, La Moora, soft as a sigh
Kissing the babies as they sail by.

Ooohh, la la la la
Kissing the babies as they sail by
La Moora, La Moora, soft as a sigh
Kissing the babies as they sail by.
