== The Little Church

[verse]
____
If you want your dream to be
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely

Day by day, stone by stone
Build your secret slowly
Day by day, you'll grow too
You'll know heaven's glory

If you want your dream to be
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free
Take your, time go slowly
Do few things but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely

Day by day, stone by stone
Build your secret slowly
Day by day, you'll grow too
You'll know heaven's glory

If you want to live life free
Take your time go slowly
If you want your dream to be
Take your time, go slowly
If you want your dream to be
Take your time, go slowly
If you want to live life free
Take your time go slowly
If you want to live life free
Take your time go slowly

== The Lovely Day

[verse]
____
Birds are singing sweet and low
From the trees that gently grow,
Soft and soothing breezes blow
On this lovely day.

To the meadows there go I
To wander as the butterfly
How the flowers please me eyes
On this lovely day.

I wish it could be always
Life is easy on such a day
I wish this peace on everyone
On this lovely day,

[movie stuff break]

On this lovely day.
I wish this peace on everyone
On this lovely day.

== Lullaby

[verse]
____
Flowers in the meadow softly sway
And all the little birds sing merry May Day
Rabbits in the orchard sport and play
And all the little creatures smile and are gay

My little boy
Sing out your joy
I am near
My darling, do not fear
Love is all around you
Comforting
With gentle lullabies
To make your heart sing

Flowers in the meadow softly sway
And all the little birds sing merry May Day
Rabbits in the orchard sport and play
And all the little creatures smile and are gay

Sing out your joy
I am near
My darling, do not fear
Love is all around you
Comforting
With gentle lullabies
To make your heart sing

[verse]
____
Brother Sun, Sister Moon
Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I seldom see you seldom hear your tune
Preoccupied with selfish misery

Brother Wind and Sister Air
Open my eyes to visions pure and fair
That I may see the glory around me.

I am God's creature, of Him I am part
I feel His love awakening my heart.

Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I now do see you, I can hear your tune
So much in love with all that I survey.

== A Soldier's Dream

[verse]
____
Oh, the drums are so mournful
My dear, oh, my love
As my thoughts they are turning your way
Where are the eyes
I beheld with my own
On that long ago lazy day?

Dead are the leaves
On the stark battlefield
The stench of the flesh sickens me
I sleep soaking wet a
And the worms eat my bread
The mourning of men fills the air

Oh, green are the leaves
On the old apple tree
Those sweet perfumed blossoms of spring
Entwined in your hair
A smile in your eyes
A soft blade of grass for a ring

Oh, the drums are so mournful
My dear, oh, my love
As my thoughts they are turning your way
Where are the eyes
I beheld with my own
On that long ago lazy day?
On that long ago lazy day

== Shape In The Sky

[verse]
____
There's a shape in the sky beckoning me
There's a sound in the wild wind calling
There's a song to be sung for glory
And I feel that it's coming our way

There's a pain on the land weakening me
There's a sigh in the city of sorrow
There's a shadow of darkness accumulating
And I feel that it's coming my way

Father of all things, Mother of light
Soothe and ease our human plight
Mary in mercy, Jesus in joy
Please, won't you help us win the fight?

There's a love for all men sleeping within
There's a friend of a friend awakening
There's a jubilant joy bursting to be
And I feel that it's coming our way

Father of all things, Mother of light
Soothe and ease our human plight
Mary in mercy, Jesus in joy
Please, won't you help us win the fight?

There's a shape in the sky beckoning me
There's a sound in the wild wind calling
There's a song to be sung for glory
And I feel that it's coming our way

There's a shape in the sky beckoning me
There's a sound in the wild wind calling
There's a song to be sung for glory
And I feel, yes, I feel, yes, I feel
That it's coming our way

== Gentle Heart

[verse]
____
Fishes are in love with water
Birds are in love with the air
Rain is in the river flowers
And there is music everywhere
Clouds are in love with the mountains
Trees are in love with the hill
I'm in love with you, my sweet one
And I guess I always will

Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, growing
Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, glowing

All the world's a shining marble
Floating in the mystery
All my life I have been looking
For that which I cannot see
Dreams they are the signs which lead us
Through the darkness to the light
We give thanks to all who teach us
Showing us the true insight

Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, growing
Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, glowing

Fishes are in love with water
Birds are in love with the air
Rain is in love with the flowers
And there is music everywhere
Clouds are in love with the mountains
Trees are in love with the hill
I'm in love with you, my sweet one
And I guess I always will

Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, growing
Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, glowing

All the world's a shining marble
Floating in the mystery
All my life I have been looking
For that which I cannot see
Dreams they are the signs which lead us
Through the darkness to the light
We give thanks to all who teach us
Showing us the true insight

Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, growing
Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, glowing
Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, growing
Gentle heart, sing my song
Gentle heart, glowing

[verse]
____
The bee is on the wing
Leaves uncurl yellow green
The year is awaking
The year is awaking

Long garden overgrown
With wild flowers sewn
The year is awaking
The year is awaking

Birds fluting overhead
Are making feather bed
The year is awaking
The year is awaking

The bee is on the wing
Leaves uncurl yellow green
The year is awaking
The year is awaking
The year is awaking
The year is awaking
The year is awaking

== Island Of Circles

[verse]
____
Over the mountain
Over the sea
From the island of circles
My love calls to me

Her hair in the north wind
Brown berry eyes
Reading the birdrooms
In the winter sky

She sway like the willow
Clothed all in stars
Moon drops of silver
Fire gold from Mars

Over the mountain
Over the sea
From the island of circles
My love calls to me

Her hair in the north wind
Brown berry eyes
Reading the birdrooms
In the winter sky
In the winter sky
