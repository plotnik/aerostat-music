== Skip-A-Long Sam

[verse]

Come run jump skip a long sam
a very happy man I am
to know you are well and you're doing fine
kind-of puts at rest my mind

How's your brush and your lady fair
not to mention your stained glass stair
flower pot on window sill
on top of honeycomb hill

Have you found the secret door
to let you down to the earth's deep core
you'll be back in time for tea
with a diamond to show me

Come run jump skip a long sam
a very happy man I am

== Sun

[verse]
____
Sun, the earth is turning
it's turning round
and love is the access
but they chop the tree down
all the proud trees are standing
as green as the sky

that makes seabirds fly

ovens area baking
and the rivers run dry
as dry as the ocean
on wings of a fly
go if you're able
and come if you can
life's very unstable
it's built upon sand

marianne set the table
an old friend I see
marianne fetch the papers
there's two for tea

Could it be occurred to me while lonely

Born to beautify the page
If I used time to set it down

Could it be occured to me while lonely
I was of high lineage
Cast up in a dreadful age
Born to be the hermit of my line

On a windy Saturday
St. Alban's market day
Little did I know
the work I was to do
Or the love I had to show

Under the greenwood tree
who loves to lie with me
and tune his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat
come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see no enemy
but winter and rough weather

Who doth ambition shun
and love to live in the sun
seeking the food he eats
and pleased with what he gets
come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see no enemy
but winter and rough weather

and if it do come to pass
that any man turn ass
leaving his wealth and ease
a stubborn will to please
ducdame ducdame ducdame
there shall he see gross fools as he
an if he will come to me

== The Land Of Doesn't Have To Be

[verse]
____
There is a land not far from the ears of sound
the eyes of sight can't see
it's over the trees
you'll be there by tomorrow's breeze

few people get there quick by their chosen road
they don't know it quicker to go
by natural velocity

there is a wall of doubt surrounding
everything that's there
children fair
they ride there
on the dreamy mare

and at the great big gate
waiters wait
they must fill the form
denounce the norm
they are torn
twixt praise and scorn

and in the dawning dawn
yawners yawn
not knowing they've been
or they've seen
what they've seen
or never seen 
____

== Someone's Singing

[verse]
____
Oh, happy I am
Call on the new day
People and flowers
Are one in the same
They're all in a chain
At the beginning of a new world

Someone's singing and I think it's me
Someone's living and oh gosh it's me
And so you see...

Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me [x2]

Into your life
There will come friends
Maybe a wife
Who to you sends
Love with no game
Part of a chain
At the beginning of a new child

Someone's singing and I think it's me
Someone's living and I think it's me
So you see...

Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for you [x2]

Oh, happy I am
Roll on the new day
Happy I am
People and flowers
Are one and the same
They're all in a chain
At the beginning of a new world

Someone's painting and I think it's me
Someone's living and oh gosh it's me
And so you see...

Love is only feeling
Feeling for you
Love is only feeling
Feeling for me [x3]

== Song Of The Naturalist's Wife

[verse]
____
Do I see you coming home
Coming home to me
Could it be you that I see
Coming home to me
From your day by the sea

Do I see your buckets full
Buckets full of shells
Could it be you that I see
Buckets full of shells
From your day by the sea

Do I see you weary weave
Weary weave your way
Could it be you that I see
Weary weave your way
From your day by the sea 
____

== The Enchanted Gypsy

[verse]
____
A day once dawned,
As sleepers yawned
A day of leaves so green-i-o
That a man rode high
In the tinker's sky
And begged me to go running-o
And follow the path of the Gypsy-o

Seaweed clings to ruby rings
On the fingers of my lady-o
And the people in the town
They would not look round
To see me go running-o
On the trail of the Enchanted Gypsy-o

I passed the glade
And took near shade
Beneath an oak so twisty-o
And a vision I saw
As the crow did craw
No more did I go searching-o
One the trail of the Enchanted Gypsy-o

Seaweed clings to ruby rings
On the fingers of my lady-o
And the people in the town
They would not look round
To see me go running-o
On the trail of the Enchanted Gypsy-o

His caravan
Was painted by hand
That's touched every pebble in the ocean-o
And the pictures there
They move in thin air
There forever telling-o
The tails of the Enchanted Gypsy-o

Seaweed clings to ruby rings
On the fingers of my lady-o
And the people in the town
They would not look round
To see me go running-o
For to follow the path of the Gypsy-o

== Voyage  Into The Golden Screen

[verse]
____

In the golden garden bird of peace
Stands the silver girl the Wild Jewels niece
Paints and pretty colors Children's drawings on the wall
Look of doubt I cast you out be gone your ragged call

In the forest thick a trick of light
Makes an image magnet to my sight
Gown of purple velvet enchanted glazed eye
The sound of wings and sparkling rings behold a crimson sky

Tread to light so not to touch the grass
Breathe the air so slowly as you pass
Silent sudden dewdrop remains unseen until
Eyes to fall to hidden call the power of Love and Will

Symphonies of seaweed dance and swoon
Surreal celestial shore beneath the moon
See the dark and mighty peaks pierce the cumulus
Violet and mauve they power you can sus'

Elvin fingers clutch a deep black cloak of fine damask
Aged rock incarnate lie reveal a jeweled cask 
____

== Isle Of Islay

[verse]
____
How high the gulls fly
O'er Ilay
How sad the farm lad
deep in play
Felt like a grain on your sand

How well the sheep's bell
music makes
Roving the cliff
when fancy takes
Felt like a tide left me here

How blessed the forest
with birdsong
How neat the cut peat
laid so long
Felt like a seed on your land 
____

== The Mandolin Man And His Secret

[verse]
____
He came into town with his mandolin
Calling all the people and they came to him
He said I want to hear all that's pretty
He said I want to hear all that's nice

They laughed at him with his mandolin
They left him there with his funny grin
He said I want to hear all that's pretty
He said I want to hear all that's nice

The children of the town then came to him
Magically called with his mandolin
He said I want to hear all that's pretty
He said I want to hear all that's nice

They smiled at him with his mandolin
Their eyes like his were sparkling
He said I want to hear all that's pretty
He said I want to hear all that's nice

They said d'you want to hear all that's pretty
They said d'you want to hear all that's nice

== Lay Of The Last Tinker

[verse]
____

I can see by your eyes you're a good man,
and the sparkle of the ring on your hand.
You have a muzzled dancing monkey,
a little cup in a hairy hand.

(I'll) bring cheese with me.
Won't you bring bread and have some wine?
Break cheese with me.
Won't you break bread and have some wine?

A goat skinned tamborine
what sites that has seen
Blazing eyes of dances
daughters of tinker queens.

(I'll) bring cheese with me.
Won't you bring bread and have some wine?
Break cheese with me.
Won't you break bread and have some wine?

Ya hang your cloak in a gypsy fashin.
I see a scar of an ancient lashing.
Born a babe in Macedonia
to the shounds of seas a-crashing.

Break cheese with me.
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
Break cheese with me.
Won't you break bread and have some wine?

I can see by your eyes you're a good man,
and the sparkle of the ring on your hand.
You have a muzzled dancing monkey,
a little cup in a hairy hand.

I can see by your eyes you're a good man,
and the sparkle of the ring on your hand.
You have a muzzled dancing monkey,
a little cup in a hairy hand.

== The Tinker And The Crab

[verse]
____
On the windy beach the sun is shining through with weather fair
White horses riding on the seas pasture onto the sand
Over the Dunes came a travelling man
Sack on back Wild flowers in his hand
Old rusty cans, pebbles 'bedded in the sand stand and stare

Scratching his beard through the grass he steered his sandy shoe
Disappearing in the dips pondering and wandering along
Nice as you please comes the travelling man
Drinking a bottle of milk in his hand
Speaking to no one in particular but happily

Down where the gulls dance driftwood lying drying for the fire
Yellow beak and sleek now the gulls are crying flying higher
Out from the sea came a little green Crab
Taking the Sun the morning being very drab
Old rusty cans, pebbles 'bedded in the sand stand and stare

The Tinker and the Crab
The Tinker and the Crab

== Widow With Shawl (A Portrait)

[verse]
____
Dear Wind that shakes the barley free
Blow home my true love's ship to me, fill the sail
I a-weary wait upon the shore.

Forsake her not in times of storm
Protect her oaken beams from harm, fill her sail
I a-weary wait upon the shore.

Whither he be in Africa
or deep asleep in India, fill his dreams
I a-weary wait upon the shore.

Dear snow white gulls upon the wave
I, like you, am lamenting, for my love.
I a-weary cry upon the shore.

And in my chariot of sleep,
I ride the vast and dreamy deep deep sea.
I awake a-weary on the shore.

Seven years and Seven days,
no man has seen my woman ways, dear God.
I a-weary cry upon the shore.

Along the shingled beach I go
The wind about me as I make my way
to my weary dream upon my bed.

Dear Wind that shakes the barley free
Blow home my true love's ship to me, fill the sail.
I a-weary wait upon the shore.

== The Lullaby Of Spring

[verse]
____
Spring has showered frae a drip
Splash and trickle running,
Plant has flowered in the sand
Shell and pebble sunning;

So begins another spring,
Green leaves under berries,
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Mother bird eating cherries

In the misty, tangled sky,
Fast a wind is blowing
In a new born rabbit's heart
River life is flowing

So begins another spring,
Green leaves under berries,
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Mother bird eating cherries

From the dark and wetted soil,
Petals are unfolding
From the stony village "Kirke"
Easter bells of old ring

So begins another spring,
Green leaves under berries,
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Mother bird eating cherries

Spring has flowered frae a drip,
Slash and trickle running
Plant has flowered in the sun
Shell and pebble sunning

So begins another spring
Green leaves under berries,
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Mother bird eating cherries 
____

== The Magpie

[verse]
____
The Magpie is a most illustrious bird
dwells in a diamond tree
one brings sorrow and one brings joy
sorry and joy for me

The Magpie is a most royal bird
black and blue as night
I would that I had feathers three
black and blue and white

I saw the gentle Magpie bird
in the dusky yestereve
one brings sorrow and one brings joy
sorrow and joy for me....
sorrow and joy for me....

== Starfish-On-The-Toast

[verse]
____
Fine rock pooling coast
this starfish on the toast
the men in the crabbing boats they cry

Far across the harbor
and 'round the sandy cove
the shepard with his pipe and sheepy drove

big cloud tumbling high
the amazing flying sky
how the gulls are pillaging the town

fan faring daffodilly
trumpetingly small
all along the bathing hut wall

far across the empty beach
the tide has left this world
old men in tweed find study there

Holding whelks and periwinkles
tingling in his hand
little does he know they hold him too

Fine rock pooling coast
this starfish on the coast
the men in the crabbing boat they cry.... 
____

== Epistle To Derroll

[verse]
____
Come all ye starry starfish
living in the deep blue sea
crawl to me i have proposition to make thee
would you walk the north sea floor
to Belgium from England
Bring me word of a banjo man
With a tattoo on his hand.

The spokesman of the starfish
spoke as spokesman should
"If'n you met our fee then
certainly we would,
If you cast a looking-glass
upon the scallopped sand
You'll have word o' this banjo man
with a tattoo on his hand."

"Come ye starry starfish
I know your ways are caped
maybe its because your astrologically shaped,
Converse with the herring shoals
as I know you can
Bring me word o' the banjo man
with a tattoo on his hand."

The eldest of the starfish
spoke, after a sigh,
"Youthfull as you are young man
you have a 'Wisdom Eye';
Surely you must know a looking-glass
is made from sand?
These youngfish are fooling you
about this banjo man."

"Come then aged starfish
Riddle me no more,
for news I am weary
and my heart is sore;
All on the silent seashore,
help me if you can,
Tell to me if you know
of this banjo man."

"All through the seven oceans
I am a star, most famed,
Many 'leggys' have I lost
and many have I gained,
Strange to say quite recently
I've been to Fleming Land
And if you are courteous
I'll tell you all I can."

"You have my full attention"
I answered him with glee,
His brother stars were twinkling
in the sky above the sea
So I sat there with rapt
attention, on the sand,
very anxious for to hear
of the banjo man.

"I have seen this tattooed hand
through a ship port-hole,
Steaming on the watery main
through the waves so cold,
Heard his tinkling banjo and
his voice so grand
but you must come to Belgium
to shake his tattooed hand."

"Gladly would I come oh
gladly would I go,
Had I not my work to do
and my face to show,
I rejoice to know he's well
but I must go inland,
thank you for the words you brought
of the banjo man."

I walked along the evening sand
as charcoal clouds did shift
revealing the moon shining
on the pebble drift
Contemplating every other word
the starfish said
whistly winds they filled my dreams
in my dreaming bed.
