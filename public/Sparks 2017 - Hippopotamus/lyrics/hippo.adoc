== Probably Nothing

[verse]
____
Something to tell you, but now I forget
Probably nothing
Some little story, no, nothing, not yet
Probably nothing
Don't try to think of it then it'll come
Happens a lot lately, I feel so dumb
It'll come when it comes, but I still feel so dumb

Something to tell you, but now I forget
Probably nothing
Let's just forget it, the sun's gonna set
I'm sure it was nothing
Why are looking at me in that way?
What was it that you thought I would now say?
Mild disappointment shown now in the way
That you walk away, you walk away
____

== Missionary Position

[verse]
____
It's a little retro and a bit passé
But you know you make her feel A-OK
And she feels alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position

And the acrobats, well, they tend to scoff
All you know is that you can get her off
And you feel alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position

The tried and true is good enough for me and you, for me and you
The tried and true is good enough
Don't need anymore, we don't need anymore

A rebranding effort might just be the thing
But a name's a name, and we're continuing
Always feeling fine, it ain't the wine, it's the missionary position

There are pros and cons to each different pose
But we don't see any need to get to those
‘Cause we're feeling great, a heightened state, the missionary position

The tried and true is good enough for me and you, for me and you
The tried and true is good enough
Don't need anymore, we don't need anymore
Don't need anymore, we don't need anymore

You might have positions you can recommend
But I don't know if we'll ever get to them
‘Cause we feel alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position
You might pride yourself, you're so avant-garde
But we're neoclassicists, I guess, at heart
Patronize all you like, we both like the missionary position

Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary
Missionary, missionary, missionary, missionary

It's a private matter as to frequency
But we both are smiling as you well can see
And it ain't no joke, it ain't baroque, it's the missionary position

It's a little retro and a bit passé
But you know you make her feel A-OK
And she feels alright, the stars are bright, the missionary position

== Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)

[verse]
____
It's a heartwarming song
For the easily moved
The effect is all wrong
Plain to see I'm not moved
As I stand in the light
Of a shop that is closed
God, I'd love me a fight
There's no poem just prose

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some Muzak on

There were no smoky dives
Few amours, fou or not
There were no petty crimes
Foreign substances bought
There were no midnight drives
With a crime boss's wife
Need a sentence at most
In assessing my life

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some Muzak on

Drunken and short-lived flings
Montparnasse lights
Holding a hand of kings
My hunch was right
When's that night?

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some Muzak on

Live fast and die young, live fast and die young, live fast and die young
Too late for that, too late for that
Live fast and die young, live fast and die young, live fast and die young
Too late for that, too late for that
Live fast and die young, live fast and die young, live fast and die young
Too late for that, too late for that
Live fast and die young, live fast and die young, live fast and die young
Too late for that, too late for that

Think of one single night
One so strong, you're aflame
Well, I'm sorry, time's up
Sorry, nothing will change

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some Muzak on

Edith Piaf said it better
Born to be bad
I was born to be bad
I was born to be bad
Not this time, not this time
Born to be bad
I was born to be bad
I was born to be bad
Not this time, not this time

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song but not intended for me
Listen, there is Muzak on
Edith Piaf said it better
____

== Scandinavian Design

[verse]
____
I've got nothing, just a table and two chairs
But they're beautiful and I just stand and stare
Time and space intertwined
Elegance, simple lines, Scandinavian Design

I've got nothing, just a table and two chairs
But I know that everything
I need is there
Every line, every shape
Sculptural, no escape
It's Scandinavian Design

Sometimes she comes over, I think I know why
Says the sky has bored her, what's wrong with the sky
Who am I to turn her out, all that she thinks about
Is Scandinavian Design

She stayed over, and we slept on wooden floors
She gets up at 8 and tiptoes to the door
She turns ‘round, subtle wave
Hums a tune by Sam and Dave
Scandinavian Design

Every line, every shape
Sculptural, no escape
Scandinavian Design

I've got nothing, just a table and two chairs
But they're beautiful and I just stand and stare
Time and space are intertwined
I can see this defined
Scandinavian Design

Most times she won't come but I don't really mind
Has a job to do as some guy's concubine
Chandeliers, bric-a-brac
I know that she'll be back
Scandinavian Design

Every line, every shape
Sculptural, no escape
Scandinavian Design

Time and space intertwined
Elegance, simple lines
Scandinavian Design

== Giddy Giddy

[verse]
____
Giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness

And I'm a traveling man
In a foreign land
Often I suppress
My inherent giddiness
Until I'm finally home
Throw away the comb
Kick up both my heels
And resume my giddiness
(And I'll resume my giddiness)

We're giddy, giddy, giddy
Struttin' ‘round the city
How are you today?
“I'm feelin' pretty, pretty giddy
How are you?”
I'm pretty giddy
Last week was a pity
Had a touch of flu and felt a little less than giddy, giddy
Now I'm back to giddy
Couldn't feel more giddy
If my life depended on it
“Glad to know you're back to giddy”
Giddy, giddy, giddy
Our entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness

Giddy, giddy wife
Flower of my life
Kids are all asleep
She is thinking giddiness
And so am, so am I
Sparkle in her eye
Both of us display
A little extra giddiness
A little extra giddiness

(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)
(A little extra giddiness)

Giddy, giddy kids
Often blow their lids
Normally they're giddy but at times they're acting up
Had enough
Go to bed
‘Til you're giddy
‘Til you're giddy, real giddy

From another city
Where nobody's giddy
Comes a scientific group to analyze our giddiness
“Their water ain't too giddy
Their diet ain't too giddy
We're prettier than they are but they're infinitely giddier”

Giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
They're giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness

We conclude their town
Never, never's down
Endorphin's really flow
Why it is, don't really know
We need a bigger grant
Thus we're hesitant
Honestly, no clue
Why they're so damn giddy, giddy

Giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Each and every person the epitome of giddiness
They're giddy, giddy, giddy
Their entire city
Everyone displaying an immense amount of giddiness

Giddy, giddy, giddy
They show mucho giddiness

Giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy
Giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy

== What The Hell Is It This Time?

[verse]
____
Historically, historically, we make an appeal
To something greater than we are when we need to heal
But don't concern Him with your little Band-Aid affair
His temper will flare, he'll rise from his chair

What the hell is it this time?

My God is great, my God is good, he loves every man
But show consideration when you pray in demands
His plate is filled with famine and with clean, wholesome air
If Arsenal wins, he really don't care

What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?

You've asked Him for redemption twenty times in the past
And twenty times he's granted it and again you have asked
But twenty is the limit and he's now getting peeved
And when He gets peeved, it's not to be believed

What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?

My God is great, my God is good, he loves every man
He loves every man, he loves every man
My God is great, my God is good, but show some restraint
If you're feeling faint, appeal to a saint

What the hell is it this time?
It's you again, it's you again, you get on my nerves
What the hell is it this time?
I've billions to serve, you get on my nerves

What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?

My girl has left, my dog has left, I've cracked up my car
The only one who will listen to me's tending the bar
He turns his back and walks away and I say, “hey you
I ain't hardly through”, he says, “yeah, you're through”

Our God is great, our God is good, he loves every man
But there's a limit to what even he can withstand
So be selective in what you slip under his door
If it isn't war, it may be ignored

What the hell is it this time?
My God is great, my God is good but don't waste His time
What the hell is it this time
He's dealing with crime, so don't waste His time
What the hell is it this time?
Historically, historically, we think we've carte blanche
What the hell is it this time
He don't take carte blanche
He don't take carte blanche
What the hell is it this time?
What the hell is it this time?

== Unaware

[verse]
____
Dragonflies too tired to breed
CEO too tired to lead
Home town wins more times than not
Bow-tied man is maladroit
She's Unaware, Unaware

Photos of distant star
There it is, here we are
Someone tells off-color joke
Heimlich saves man who chokes
She's Unaware, Unaware

She's Unaware, Unaware

Taylor Swift has something new
Nike has a brand new shoe
Reads your heart rate, anywhere
She don't know, she don't care
She's Unaware, Unaware

Class walks out on lecturer
Actress wears real fur
Headline act disappoints
Coral bleached off the point
She's Unaware, Unaware

She's Unaware, Unaware

Her parents stare down
Faces like two clowns
That's all she knows of, that's all
Wish I could warn her
Don't turn that corner
Stay unaware of it all

Apparitions everywhere
Silent couples sit and stare
Someone promised, didn't show
Someone says, “Have to go”
She's Unaware, Unaware

Apparitions everywhere
Silent couples sit and stare
Someone promised, didn't show
Someone says, “Have to go”
She's Unaware, Unaware

Someone must've been fooling around

Taking the piss and acting like this

There's a painting by Hieronymus, Bosch by Hieronymus, Bosch by Hieronymus in my pool

Obviously!

There's a Volkswagen microbus, a Volkswagen microbus, a Volkswagen microbus in my pool
A '58 microbus, a '58 microbus, a '58 microbus in my pool
A hippie is driving, a hippie is driving, a trippy old hippie
Poor, poor guy
A hippie is driving, a hippie is driving, I throw him a towel

Someone must've been acting real cute
Someone wearing a slippery suit
Someone must've come over the lap
Throw in a hippo and then a giraffe

There is Titus Andronicus, Titus Andronicus, Titus Andronicus in my pool
There is Titus Andronicus, Titus Andronicus wearing a snorkel in my pool
Now he's gone under, now he's gone under, now he's gone under

Excellent swimmer, excellent swimmer, looking much trimmer

== Bummer

[verse]
____
Dearly departed we
Gather here solemnly
To describe how we feel ‘bout your suddenly passing
Stories of deeds that touch
Seem like a bit too much
Then they point to me hoping for thoughts everlasting

Never, never, never know
(You) Never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
(You) never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
Bummer

All of them prattle on
Even your widow yawns
You deserve something more, but they go through the motions
They have seen on TV
People of majesty who can sum up a life with a phrase
They don't know you

It's a bummer, it's a bummer, what a bummer
Bummer

We had eyes on the same
Stunning thing, both insane
All the time, I could see
It was you
Rest in peace

Bummer, bummer, bummer
Bummer

We had the best of times, all of those petty crimes
It all had to end with your vows to be tasteful
What I said angrily
I should have kept to me
What I said to you both it was primetime disgraceful

It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer, what a bummer
It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer, what a bummer

Quoting a Shakespeare line
Citing the Bible I'm not sure that that fits, anyway I am lazy
Don't worry, I will not try hitting on her, you're fine
I respect you enough, though she still drives me crazy

It's a bummer, it's a bummer, what a bummer
Bummer

Some ol' fool says, “life goes on”
She is crushed that you're gone
Just a word says it all
Just a word, you hit that wall

Never, never, never know
(You) Never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
(You) never, never, never know
Never, never, never know
(You) never, never, never know

It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer, what a bummer
It's a bummer, it's a bummer
What a bummer
Bummer

== I Wish You Were Fun

[verse]
____
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun in every way
I wish you were fun
To brighten the dark cold winter day
In every other way I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun

I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun to be around
I wish you were fun
You say that your favorite color's brown
In every other way I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun

No one ever changes, why even bring it up?
You'll only muck it up, she'll never yuck it up
You know she's from somewhere where
Authority ruled supreme, no would ever dream
Dream of just letting off some steam

I wish you were fun
You've got it all covered ‘cept for that
I love how you run
With such a determined look at that
I shouldn't let it phase me at all but I'm just plain old dumb
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun

La la la la
La la la la la la la la la

No one ever changes, why even mention it?
Calling attention it leads to the tension that's not
Helpful, back off and accept what you have in hand
Glad that she's no Ayn Rand, humorless to the Nth degree

La la la la la
I wish you were fun
La la la la la la la la la
Fun in every way
La la la la la
I wish you were fun
La la la la
Have some Chardonnay
In every other way
I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun

I wish you were fun
And maybe you're fun in subtle ways
Too subtle for me, but maybe I'll get it all one day
But how about a somersault until you are blatantly fun
Do that, I'd be stunned
I wish you were fun

La la la la
In every other way
I find you amazing but one
I wish you were fun
I wish you were fun
____

== So Tell Me Mrs. Lincoln Aside From That How Was The Play?

[verse]
____
Only the subtext, never the text
Wish I could push a button for next
Only the surface, never the heart
When will the confab finally start?
Nodding my head like a bobblehead doll
Trying to smile, ignoring it all
Don't interrupt, you'll just cause a fuss
Hope I can catch the 10 o'clock bus

So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?

Only the warmup, still not the game
Every time exactly the same
Try to drop hints, a glance at my watch
A glance at my watch, while we slip a notch
Why is the subject so hard to broach
Must be a talent so hard to coach
Stalling without strategic intent
What should I try to give up for Lent?

So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?

Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside
Putting all of that aside

What lies underneath it all?
What lies underneath it all?
What lies underneath it all?
What lies underneath it all?

Wandering mind, meandering words
I couldn't tell you any I've heard
For the last hour, hour or two
Now I retie the lace on my shoe
Is this a breakup or is it not?
All I can tell you, man, I am shot
Don't interrupt, you'll just cause a fuss
Looks like I missed the 10 o'clock bus

So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was the play?
So tell me Mrs. Lincoln, aside from that how was your day?

What lies underneath, ignored?

== When You're A French Director
(feat. Leos Carax)

[verse]
____
When you're a French director, it seems la vie est belle
Women say "oui," they long to be, top of the bill, oh well
When you're a French director, you're an auteur as well
What does that mean?
Every scene must be obscure as hell
When you're a French director
You never smile, what's the deal?
Hollywood guys, with their CGI eyes smile
But their films lack "le feel"

When you're a French director
Un César, do you really care?
You can't admit it
But you could fit it
Right on that shelf, over there
When you're a French director
You know la vie est belle
Women say "oui," they long to be, top of the bill, oh merde
____

== The Amazing Mr. Repeat

[verse]
____
Darnell, he doesn't stand a chance
Nor Johnny nor that guy from France
Nor Sammy or the paper boy
Nor Tony who they call Leroy
The girls are waiting, single file
They might be waiting there a while
It might be dawn, it might be noon
It might be, God forbid, next June

The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again

Once more again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
He drives them crazy, drives them mad
His very own Olympiad
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
There's ecstasy on every face
Of every girl in our whole place

The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again

Once more again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
No waiting to reload at all
No waiting for that protocol

Once more again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no

Sign here, son, that's right, the dotted line
The dotted line, you'll take the world by storm
He rejects them all every time, every time
Their exploitation's met with scorn

He's on the nightly news again
They have to have him after ten
So kids are all asleep and he
Can be talked about honestly
He feels they are using him
A circus freak not really him
So he stays in the neighborhood
Still, local girls say, “damn, he's good”

Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no

The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again

Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no

The rest of us seem very slow
An intermission breaks the flow

Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no

Sign here, son, that's right, the dotted line
The dotted line and all will turn out great
He rejects them all every time, every time
Every time, I'd really rather wait

The Amazing Mr. Repeat
At your service again

Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no
Once more, again, oh no

== Life With The Macbeths
(feat. Rebecca Sjöwall)

[verse]
____
All the dreaming and scheming and playing games
Are enough to draw millions each week the same
Same station, same time, new feuds
While a rating of "R" may be generous
All that blood and ambition so onerous
Our public, the public, enthused
Life With The Macbeths is now on view

As the cameras are rolling, we roll our eyes
But our lifestyle demands that we hide our sighs
One season, that's all you'll see
As the Lady inspires me to depths unseen
Killing all in my way, some will yell "obscene"
The ratings are off the charts
Life With The Macbeths, both tart and smart

Our public, the public, enthused
Ambition leads to murder
A royal reign of terror
The critics split in fervor
Some not that into murder
Is there a deeper story?
Or is it only gory?
Strong woman prods her husband
And then regrets what's coming

Are we both to survive, well, you'll have to wait
Maybe yes, maybe no, what we can, though, state
Each murder, the ratings soar
Life With The Macbeths is sure to score
Life With The Macbeths is sure to score
