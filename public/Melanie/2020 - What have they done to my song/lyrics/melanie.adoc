== Love in my mind (love in my heart)

[verse]
____ 
When I get so lonely
That tears start to fall
I just sing it all in this little rhyme
That changes the time
From the pain of the world
To the love in my mind...

In the middle of the night
I thought I was sleepin'
I heard someone weepin' so bitterly
"Well I knew it was me"...
So I hugged on my pillow
And I think it hugged me...

Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah...

World world go away
Come again another day
When I can see I'm a pretty me
A pretty she
And I was made for the world
And the world was made for me...

Think I'll get a moonbeam
That's silver and shines
And that vows to be mine
For the rest of my time
In the loveliest rhyme
Change the pain of the world
For the love in my mind...

In the loveliest rhyme
Change the pain of the world
For the love in my mind...

In the loveliest rhyme...

Dah dah dah dah dah...

== Leftover wine

[verse]
____ 
What do you do when the people go home?
And what do you do when the show is all done?
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine

A line from a poem of my childhood has said
That visions of sugarplums were gonna dance in my head
I'll spend my whole life making the time rhyme
But I'll still have a bowl of leftover wine

I'll spend my whole life making the time rhyme
And then I'm gonna run to the people
And I'll sing 'em a song of mine
You know I'm gonna do anything just to take up time
'Cause I can't find a taker for the leftover wine

What do you do when the people go home?
What do you do when the show is all done?
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine

I'm gonna spend my whole life making the time rhyme
And then I'm gonna run to the people
And I'll sing 'em a song of mine, you know
I'm gonna do anything just to take up time
'Cause I can't find a taker for the leftover wine

I'll drink some of yours, if you'll drink all of mine
Because I can't stand the taste of that leftover wine
And I'm gonna drink some of yours, if you'll drink all of mine
Because I can't stand the taste of leftover wine
And I'll drink some of yours, if you'll drink all of mine
I can't stand the taste of leftover wine

== Momma momma

[verse]
____ 
Momma Momma, I fear you reared me wrong
Momma Momma, I fear you reared me wrong
'Cause I pick up my head, can't tell where I belong

Momma Momma, something's hurting me bad
Momma Momma, something's hurting me bad
I have a yearning for something that I never had

Oh, sometimes I feel my life has come and then it's gone
Sometimes I feel my life has come and gone
I live in this world but I'm only looking on

I can't understand, it's too far over my head
I can't understand, it's too far over my head
I'm living the life but I'm really dying instead, yeah

Momma Momma, I fear you reared me wrong
Momma Momma, I fear you reared me wrong
'Cause I lift up my head and I can't tell where I belong
Momma Momma Momma Momma, something's terribly wrong

== Peace will come (according to plan)

[verse]
____ 
There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one
There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one

For sometimes when I am feeling as big as the land
With the velvet hill in the small of my back
And my hands are playing the sand

And my feet are swimming in all of the waters
All of the rivers are givers to the ocean
According to plan, according to man

Well sometimes when I am feeling so grand
And I become the world
And the world becomes a man

And my song becomes a part of the river
I cry out to keep me just the way I am
According to plan

According to man, according to plan
According to man, according to plan

Oh there's a chance peace will come
In your life, please buy one
Oh there's a chance peace will come
In your life, please buy one

For sometimes when we have reached the end
With the velvet hill in the small of my backs
And our hands are clutching the sand

Will our blood become a part of the river
All of the rivers are givers to the ocean
According to plan, according to man

There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one

There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one
For sometime when we have reached the end
With the velvet hill in the small of my backs
And our hands are clutching the sand

There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one
There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one...

== Psychotherapy

[verse]
____ 
Oh mine eyes have seen the glory of the theories of Freud
He has taught me all the evils that my ego must avoid
Repression of the impulses resuling paranoid
As the id goes marching on
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

There was a man who thought his friends to him were all superior
And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
As the id goes marching on
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Do you drown your superego in a flood of alcohol - or something else
And go running after women till you're just about to fall
You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all
As the id goes marching on
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Oh sad is the masochism, the vagaries of sex
Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks
But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the cheques
As the id goes marching on
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands
There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man
As the id goes marching on
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Freud's mystic world of meaning needn't have us mystified
It's really very simple what the psyche tries to hide
A thing is a phallic symbol if it's longer than it's wide
As the id goes marching on
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

== Saddest thing

[verse]
____ 
And the saddest thing
Under the sun above
Is to say goodbye
To the ones you love

All the things that I have known
Be came my life my very own
But before you know you say goodbye
Oh, good time, goodbye
It's time to cry
But I will not weep nor make a scene
Just say "thank you
Life for having been"

And the hardest thing
Under the sun above
Is to say goodbye to the ones you love
No I will not weep nor make a scene
I'm gonna say "thank you
Life for having been"

And the loudest cry
Under the sun above
Is to silent goodbye
From the ones you love
Aaahaaha... 
____ 

== Good book

[verse]
____ 
Poor little hairy kids out on their own
They run to the festival to show that they were one
They've fallen in love with all human kind
So tell them you love them so they don't change their mind

Write us a book of instructions or signs
And if it's been written then give us more time
Recite a poem or sing us a song
And tell us you love us so we don't feel alone

And it's sad that we weren't born like horses and sheep
To know where we're goin', to know what we need
But you've written the music so we'll sing along
But tell us you love us so we don't feel alone

Give the poet a poem and the singer a song
And they'll tell us you love us
So we don't feel alone
So we don't feel alone
So we don't feel alone
You gotta tell us you love us
So we don't feel all alone 
____ 

== Nickel song

[verse]
____ 
Well you know that I'm not a gambler
But I'm being gambled on
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song
Da-da-da-da...
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song

Well, I don't mind that they're lucky
But it seems that they always win
And gamblin' is illegal in the state of mind I'm in
And if I had a nickel for each time that
I've been put on
I would be their nickel man
And I'd sing a little song

They're only putting in a nickel and
They want a dollar song
They're only putting in a little to
Get rid of a lot that's
Wrong

Well I don't know so many things
But I know what's been goin' on
We're only putting in a little
To get rid of a lot that's wrong
And if we had a nickel for each time that
We've been put on
We'd all be their nickel man
And we'd sing a nickel song
You know they're only putting in a nickel
And they win a dollar song
Oh, yeah, they're only putting in a little
To get rid of a lot that's wrong
Oh, they're only putting in a nickel
To win a dollar song

== God's only daughter

[verse]
____ 
I'm God's only daughter
I'm the one that he grows his garden for
I'm beginning to see him more and more
And I see my papa in the morning

I'm God's favourite little girl
I'm his own pride and joy in the whole big world
I'm his favourite song he likes to sing
And he sings it best in the morning

And you know I just can't hide
The way that I feel inside
When the sun hits my eyes in the morning

When I go to bed at night
He gives me a smile and turns out the light
And he tells me a tale of loving
And he'll kiss me hello in the morning

And you know I just can't hide
The way that I feel inside
When the sun hits my eyes in the morning

I'm God's only daughter
I'm the one that he grows his garden for
I'm beginning to see him more and more
And I see him best in the morning

== Pebbles in the sand

[verse]
____ 
Isn't it grand
I picked up a pebble on the sand
It knows my hand
I taught the sea my song
And it sings it for me when I am gone

Seasons of rain
I bring my little river
The sea knows my pain
I gave the sea my tears
And they'll cry for you when I am not here

Under the sun
All of the pebbles on the sand
Know why I've come
The sea knows what I've done
And it missed the sea toys that I took home
And it's gonna miss me when I am gone
And it's gonna miss you 'cause we are one

Isn't it grand
Picked up a pebble on the sand
It knows my hand
I taught the sea my song
And it sings it for me when I am gone
And it's gonna miss me when I am gone
____ 

== Please love me

[verse]
____ 
Please love me
Please, please love me
After all my show is absolutely free
So please love me

Tell them all
The price is low
The high don't fall
They've loved much less
And paid much more for company
Don't build me up
Don't tear me down,
Just let 'em see
The song's the thing that makes it free

But maybe I'm wrong
If the price is high
Then they will love the song
If that's the case
Than they'll erase all that I've sung
They're gonna rest assured
That I was singing just for fun
And that I couldn't really matter to no one
How could I matter if I'm free
Oh won't you please love me
Please, please love me

Please love me
Please, please love me
It's all much grander
Than the pennies and the cheers
It's what you get from living all these years
And then seeing me,
Won't you please love me, ah

Please, please love me
After all my show is practically free
So please love me

== Any guy

[verse]
____ 
I was bored
I would not compromise
Wanted more
So I looked in your eyes
But it could have been any guy's
It could have been any guy's eyes
But your eyes were there
And they started to stare
But don't think that I care - No.

Now you got
The feeling you're great
Cause we shared
A few looks
And I made one mistake
But it could have been any one
I was looking for that kind of fun
And you were right there
In love, all is fair
But don't think that I care

Now you got
A new friend I know
So I'm packing my things
And I'm going to go
Please don't make a scene
Don't cry
You can't stop me if you try
I love being free
It's the best way to be
Is she as pretty as me, huh?? (3x)
Is she as pretty as me, huh-huh?
Is she as pretty as me, huh.

== Baby guitar

[verse]
____
Have you heard the word
Our friend is gonna be a star
She's gonna get the chauffeur
And she's gonna get the car
And she's gonna get the love
Of the people at the bar
And she's gonna give birth
To a Baby Guitar

Well, rumor says our good friend
Has done some carrying on
And rumor says in public
She makes love to all her songs
In front of the frustration
Of the people at the bar
She's got the nerve to mess around
With her guitar

Oh, it was sad
To see the breakdown
Of the princess' fallin' star
One day when she was doin'
All the people at the bar
She did a little don't
And they pulled her head apart
And neatly tucked away inside
Her eyelid was her heart
Then they looked at one another
Said we knew it
There you are
A nameless illegitimate Baby Guitar

Now her lovin' loyal friends
Took the offspring for there own
And according to it's birthright
They built it a thrown
And now just like his mommy
He does the people at the bar
And they look at one another
And say he's gonna be a star
Rememberin' well the mother
Of the Baby Guitar

== I don't eat animals

[verse]
____ 
I was just thinking about the way it's supposed to be
I'll eat the plants and the fruit from the trees
And I'll live on vegetables and I'll grow on seeds
But I don't eat animals and they don't eat me
Oh no, I don't eat animals 'cause I love them, you see
I don't eat animals, I want nothing dead in me

I don't eat white flour, white sugar makes you rot
Oh, white could be beautiful but mostly it's not
A little bit of whole meal, some raisins and cheese
But I don't eat animals and they don't eat me
Oh no, I don't eat animals 'cause I love them, you see
I don't eat animals, I want nothing dead in me

A little bit of whole meal, some raisins and cheese
I'll eat the plants and the fruit from the trees
And I'll live on vegetables and I'll grow on seeds

You know I'll become life and my life will become me
You know I'll live on life and my life will live on me

== I'm back in town

[verse]
____ 
I'm back in town
You don't look so happy 'cause I'm back in town
You don't look like smiling
Don't jump up and down on my toes
I guess I better go, oh

I'm very sure
I should have knocked when I opened the door
Pardon me miss, but he's just a friend from before
Who never locked his door
I opened without knocking like before

You wrote me that all was the same
So I came
But I can't find the love in your eyes
I guess that you're surprised
Just like me
I never thought you'd find another she
You liked as well as me
But I guess I was wrong
So I'll be going home, oh.

I'm back in town.
Didn't they tell you that I'm back in town?
You don't look so happy
Don't jump up and down on my toes
You loved me once, you know
I guess that you don't love me anymore

I'm back in town
Didn't they tell you that I'm back in town?
You don't look so happy
Don't jump up and down on my toes
You loved me once, you know

[verse]
____ 
Johnny Boy, my friend
It is the end
Of the summertime
And the wine
In the tree
You and me
You recall all the tears
I had fears
You could not stop them from falling
Johnny Boy, my friend
They're falling again

Johnny Boy, my friend
Stop them again
For a lonely girl
In the world
Of the stone buildings
That would turn brown
If they were born
In the town
Where the trees are grown
Johnny Boy, I'm all alone
Please take me home

Johnny Boy, my friend
Please hold my hand
In the middle of the night
When the world crashes
With all its might
Johnny Boy, if you had pain
I would do the same
Johnny Boy, my friend
You gotta help me again

== Ruby tuesday

[verse]
____ 
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and then she goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't ask her why she leaves to be so free
She's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
But such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

There's no time to lose I heard her say
You gotta catch your dreams before they run away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you might lose your mind
Is life unkind

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
