== The Drifter

[verse]
____
Jesse and the padre try to keep things cool
Knowing exactly how to make stone into jewels
The judge was the kind of man who always talked fast
And the way things were going
His world wouldn't last
The desperado’s make a plan
To set the town on fire
And when they try to make a stand
They were ambushed at the wire
The drifter never stays to fight
He keeps running till he's way out of sight
But it gets him nowhere
And the driftеr never pays the pricе
He's running through the day and the night
But he’s running to nowhere
The judge said boys don't you know this town is mine
Don't going try to change it everything will be just fine
Those desperadoes don't pay them no mind
Everybody knows that they can't read or write
The judge put Jesse in the jail
Although there is no crime
The padre tried to get him out
With a stick of dynamite
The drifter never stays to fight
He keeps running till he's way out of sight
But it gets him nowhere
And the drifter never pays a price
He's running through the day and the night
But he's running to nowhere
Oh no
The drifter knows he can’t always go with the tide
The time will come when he’ll have to choose up sides
Which way will he go will it be left or right
The judge says things are either black or white
The desperado's make a plan
To set the town on fire
And when they try to make a stand
They were ambushed at the wire
The drifter never stays to fight
He keeps running till he’s way out of sight
But it gets him nowhere
And the drifter never pays the price
He's running through the day and the night
But he's running to nowhere

== Gypsy Rider

[verse]
____
Crank her over once again
Put your face into the wind
Find another road where you're never been
Sing that two-wheeled melody
The highway symphony
You know she'll never understand

Gypsy Rider sing
Your who-wheeled symphony
You know there's nothing to explain
She should have known by now
You're just a vagabond
You may never pass this way again

All the writings on the wall
The paper all must fall
You're only as good as your word remains
You can take it out if you
Decide to follow through
Just take what you earn and leave what remains

Gypsy Rider sing
Your two-wheeled symphony
You know there's nothing to explain
She should have known by now
You're just a vagabond
You may never pass this way again

== Every Angel In Heaven

[verse]
____
Garrett Waller pulled out of Memphis
Can't go back to Tennessee
Worked the day and I knew I was through
On a farm in the Shenandoah Valley
And Atlanta got too crowded
So I crept out without a sound
I was drunk and I can’t remember
Even the Wallens ran me out of town
So I tried to settle down one summer
But from love I fell from grace
How the bridge in that cold November
I thought I'd disappear without a trace

And then I saw every Angel in Heaven
I saw them drеssed as white as light
And then all of my dеspair I could see them standing there
To help me through that lonely night
Help me through that lonely night

Spent some time in a Texas prison
The man said he wanted my life
He thought I'd cheated him so he came at me
With a gun but I had a knife
When I got out I kept on wonderin’
Texas was no place to be
The man had killed and lots of family there
And all of them were trying to find me

And then I saw every Angel in Heaven
I saw them dressed as white as light
And then all of my despair I could see them standing there
To help me through that lonely night
Help me through that lonely night

Every time I find myself at the end of my rope
There's a noose waiting for me to be hung
And when I get the mind I put it over my head
The Angels always seem to come
The Angels always seem to come

I was standing on the platform
Found a ticket on the ground
Don't matter where it takes me
Anywhere is somewhere bound
I was crushing out my last smoke
As the train pulled in on time
The conductor waved his lantern
As a bell began to chime

And then I saw every Angel in Heaven
I saw them dressed as white as light
And then all of my despair I could see them standing there
To help me through this lonely night
Help me through this lonely night
Help me through this lonely night
Help me through this lonely night

== Del Gato

[verse]
____
My name is Del Gato born close to the border
Of white blood and red blood I came
I travel the saddle I follow the cattle
Down on the range where they graze
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive
My lips parched and bloodied
My face torn by sand storms and pride
Loyalty riches and inner bred ditches ?
Was the brew that I drank as a child
So rebellious a lover
Don Juan as a my cover
They die cast my type called me wild ?
And I just ride in from a hard southwestern drive
The hanging tree is waiting for me to arrive

Structured political our children they ridiculed
They teach them of sins and to lie
Their schools build't by fools but by breaking the rules
Like A fox I am forced now to hide
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive
My lips parched and bloodied
My face torn by sand storms and pride
Pepper tree spreads taking many mans heads ?
But the one they would want most is mine

To the mission I go I
In San Juan and I kneel
And I pray for the love of my life
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive
My lips parched and bloodied
My face torn by sand storms and pride

## Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)

The crops are all in and the peaches are rott'ning,
The oranges piled in their creosote dumps,
They're flying 'em back to the Mexican border
To pay all their money to wade back again

Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita,
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria,
You won't have your names when you ride the big airplane,
All they will call you will be "deportees"

My father's own father, he waded that river,
They took all the money he made in his life,
My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees,
And they rode the truck till they took down and died.

Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted,
Our work contract's out and we have to move on,
Six hundred miles to that Mexican border,
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves.

We died in your hills, we died in your deserts,
We died in your valleys and died on your plains.
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes,
Both sides of the river, we died just the same.

The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon,
A fireball of lightning, and shook all our hills,
Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?
The radio says, "They are just deportees"

Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?
To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil
And be called by no name except "deportees"?

== Fair And Tender Ladies

[verse]
____
My daddy was a handsome gambler
He had a chain five miles long
On every link a heart gets dangled
Of another maid he loved and wronged

He told to you some loving story
He'd make you think he'd leave them true
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun refused to shine
Than to live here in Missouri
With your memory always on my mind

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how your court your man
They're like a star on a summer's morning
First they appear then they're gone again
Your man
They're like a star on a summer morning
First they appear then they're gone again
____

== Almost Saturday Night

[verse]
____
Outside my window, I can hear the radio
And you know that motor wagon is getting ready to fly
Cause it's almost Saturday night

Bye bye, tomorrow, Jody's gone to the rodeo
And you know some good old boys are getting ready to ride
Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have it's way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm-a-goin'

Outside the ringing, the night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion get ready to fly
Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have it's way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm-a-goin'

Outside the ringing, the night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion get ready to fly

Cause it's almost Saturday night
Outside the windows cause it;s almost Saturday night

== I'm Your Toy (Hot Burrito #1)

[verse]
____
You may be, sweet and nice, but that won't keep you warm at night
Cuz I'm the one, who showed you how, to do the things you're doing now
He may feel, all your charms, he may hold you in his arms
But I'm the one, who let you in, I was right beside you then

Once upon a time, you let me feel you deep inside
And nobody knew, nobody saw, do you remember the way you cried?
I'm your toy, I'm your ol' boy

But I don't want no one but you to love me
I'm your toy, I'm your ol' boy
But I don't want no one but you to love me
No, I wouldn't lie, you know I'm not that kind of guy
____

== Are We Still Making Love

[verse]
____
Are we still making love
Or is it just part of the game?
Have we both had enough
Of life being the same?
Are we still making love?
It's so hard to say no
And though things might be rough
Maybe it's time to let go

Our life's come full circle now again
We lived life so fast we thought it couldn't end
And though we hurt each other so
All we had to know
Was how our heartaches began

Are we still making love
Or is it just part of the game?
Have we both had enough
Of life being the same?
Are we still making love?
It's so hard to say no
And though things might be rough
Maybe it's time to let go

I've had some good love now and then
I know I've stumbled, but I've gotten up again
And somehow the good times that we had
They don't outweigh the bad
Oh how can we bring it to an end?

Are we still making love
Or is it just part of the game?
Have we both had enough
Of life being the same?
Are we still making love?
It's so hard to say no
And though things might be rough
Maybe it's time to let go

== Why Did You Leave Me Today

[verse]
____
For so long worked so hard
We didn't have a dime
But we had one anothers love
That was all the time

Then one day our ship came in
The answer to our dreams
A mansion filled with social life
And golden leopardskins

Why did you leave me today
I was going to give you the world
I watched my dream fly away
All I can say why did you leave today

As I walked thru these grand old halls
I feel so cold inside
Stare upon these grand old walls
And all their costly prizes

I realize I'd gladly trade them
Thеse worldly things
To lie besidе you one more time
And share only our dreams

Why did you leave me today
I was going to give you the world
I watched my dream slip away
All I can say why did you leave today
Why did you leave me today

== Don't It Make You Want To Go Home

[verse]
____
Oh the whippoorwill roosts on the telephone pole
And the Georgia sun goes down
Well it's been a long time but I'm glad to say I'm
Goin' back down to my home town

Goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna buy me a one way fare
Good lord willin' and the creek don't rise
By tomorrow I'll be right there

Don't it make you want to go home now
Don't it make you want to go home
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you want to go home

But there's a six-lane highway down by the creek
Where I went skinny dippin' as a child
And a drive-in show wherе the meadow used to grow
And strawbеrries used to grow wild

There's a drag strip down by the riverside
Where my grandma's cow used to graze
Now the grass don't grow and the river don't flow
Like it did in my childhood days

Don't it make you want to go home now
Don't it make you want to go home
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you want to go home
Don't it make you want to go home

Don't it make you want to go home now
Don't it make you want to go home
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you want to go home
Don't it make you want to go home

== Number One Is To Survive

[verse]
____
Things had gotten out of hand
We had ceased to understand
What had started out as fun
Has now become a loaded gun
Wish we could start again this time
But things would be the same old mess
We'll have to leave it now behind
Hoping you'd find your own address
You know I'm headed for the sun
And you are reaching for the blind
I can hardly find the words
And you can hardly find your mind
Wish there was something I could say
To make things better or OK
You think you're right all of the time
So what's the use to speak my mind
And I know you well
And I know it's hell
You've got to kick this thing alive
And if you look upon my list
Number one is to survive

And I know you well
And I know it's hell
You've got to kick this thing alive
And if you look upon my list
Number one is to survive
And if you look upon my list
Number one is to survive

== Mary Sue

[verse]
____
Used to take a run out of Bonner Springs
Go and take look at the girls up in Tonganoxie
Me and JD
\`58 Pontiac, baby moons
All waxed up, sittin` in the light of the moon
She was somethin` to see
Oo-oo Mary Sue
I wonder by now who you are married to
Oo-oo Mary Sue
I wonder if your memory remembers me like I remember you.
Going out cruisin` on a Saturday night
Always had Susan my Mary Sue holdin` me tight
Always by my side
Meetin` on the top of the hill west of town
Quarter mile run meanest machine shuts \`em down
I love that sound
Oo-oo Mary Sue
I wonder by now who you are married to
Oo-oo Mary Sue
I wonder if your memory remembers me like I remember you.
The years rolled by and I went far away
Anyway the wind would blow
But in my mind I see her everyday
Why did I ever let her go?
Used to take a run out of Bonner Springs
