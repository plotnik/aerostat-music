== One Misty Moisty Morning

[verse]
____
One misty moisty morning when cloudy was the weather
I met with an old man a-clothed all in leather
He was clothed all in leather with a cap beneath his chin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

This rustic was a thresher as on his way he hied
And with a leather bottle fast buckled by his side
He wore no shirt upon his back but wool unto his skin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

I went a little further and there I met a maid
A-going a-milking, a-milking Sir she said
Then I began to compliment and she began to sing
Saying how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

This maid her name was Dolly clothed in a gown of grey
I being somewhat jolly persuaded her to stay
And straight I fell a-courting her in hopes her love to win
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

I having time and leisure, I spent a vacant hour
A-telling of my treasure while sitting in the bower
With many kind embraces I stroke her double chin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

I said that I would married be and she would be my bride
And long we should not tarry and twenty things beside
I'll plough and sow and reap and mow and you shall sit and spin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

Her parents then consented, all parties were agreed
Her portion thirty shillings, we married were with speed
Then Will the piper he did play whilst others dance and sing
Saying how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

Then lusty Ralph and Robin with many damsels gay
Did ride on Roan and Dobbin to celebrate the day
And when they met together their caps they off did fling
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do
And how do you do again

== Alison Gross

[verse]
____
Alison Gross that lives in yon tower
The ugliest witch in the North Country
Has trysted me one day up to her bower
And many a fair speech she made to me

She stroked my head and she combed my hair
She set me down softly on her knee
Saying if you will be my lover so true
So many good things I would give to you

Away, away, you ugly witch
Go far away and let me be
I never will be your lover so true
And wish I were out of your community

[Chorus]

Alison Gross she must be
The ugliest witch in the North Country
Alison Gross she must be
The ugliest witch in the North Country

She showed me a mantle of red scarlet
With golden flowers and fringes fine
Saying if you will be my lover so true
This goodly gift it shall be thine

She showed me a shirt of the softest silk
Well wrought with pearls abound the band
Saying if you will be my lover so true
This goodly gift you shall command

[Chorus]

She showed me a cup of the good red gold
Well set with jewels so fair to see
Saying if you will be my lover so true
This goodly gift I will give to thee

Away, away, you ugly witch
Go far away and let me be
I never would kiss your ugly mouth
For all of the gifts that you could give

[Chorus]

She turned her right and round about
And thrice she blew on a grass-green horn
She swore by the moon and the stars up above
That she'd make me rue the day I was born

Then out she has taken a silver wand
She's turned her three times round and round
She muttered such words till my strength it did fail
And she's turned me into an ugly worm

[Chorus]

== The Bold Poachers

[verse]
____
Concerning of three young men
One night in January
According laws contrary
A-poaching went straightway

They were inclined to ramble
Amongst the trees and brambles
A-firing at the pheasants
Which brought the keepers nigh

The keepers dared not enter
Nor cared the woods to venture
But outside near the center
In them old bush they stood

The poachers they were tired
And to leave they were desired
At, at last young Parkins fired
And spilled one keeper's blood

Fast homeward they were making
Nine pheasants they were taking
When another keeper faced them
They fired at him also

He on the ground lay crying
Just like some person dying
With no assistance nigh him
May God forgive their crime

Then they were taken with speed
All for that inhuman deed
It caused their hearts to bleed
For their young tender years

There seen before was never
Three brothers tried together
Three brothers condemned for poaching
Found guilty as they stood

Exiled in transportation
Two brothers they were taken
And the other hung as a token
May God forgive their crime

== The Ups And Downs

[verse]
____
As I was going to Aylesbury all on a market day
A pretty little Aylesbury girl I met upon the way
Her business was to market with butter, cheese and whey
And we both jogged on together my boys, fol-der-o diddle-o-day
And we both jogged on together my boys, fol-der-o diddle-o-day

As we jogged on together my boys together side by side
By chance this fair maid's garter by chance it came untied
For fear that she might lose it I unto her did say
Your garter's come untied my love, fol-der-o diddle-o-day
Your garter's come untied my love, fol-der-o diddle-o-day

As we jogged on together my boys to the outskirts of the town
At length this fair young damsel she stopped and looked around
Oh, since you've been so venturesome pray tie it up for me
Oh, I will if you go to the apple grove, fol-der-o diddle-o-day
Oh, I will if you go to the apple grove, fol-der-o diddle-o-day

And when we got to the apple grove the grass was growing high

I laid this girl upon her back her garter for to tie
While tying of her garter such sights I never did see
And we both jogged on together my boys, fol-der-o diddle-o-day
And we both jogged on together my boys, fol-der-o diddle-o-day

O since you've had your will of me come tell to me your name
Likewise your occupation and where and whence you came
My name is Mickey the drover boy from Dublin town come I
And I live at the sign of the ups and downs, fol-der-o diddle-o-day
And I live at the sign of the ups and downs, fol-der-o diddle-o-day

And when she got to Aylesbury her butter was not sold
And the losing of her maidenhead it made her blood run cold
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, she said, he's not the lad for me
For he lives at the sign of the ups and downs, fol-der-o diddle-o-day
For he lives at the sign of the ups and downs, fol-der-o diddle-o-day

== The Wee Wee Man

[verse]
____
'Twas down by Carterhaugh Father
Between the water and the wall
There I met with a wee wee man
And he was the least that ever I saw

His legs were scarce a finger's length
And thick and nimble was his knee
Between his eyes a flee could go
Between his shoulders were inches three

His beard was long and white as as swan
His robe was neither green nor gray
He clapped his hands, down came the mist
And he sank and he's fainted clean away

He pulled up a stone six feet in height
And flung it farther than I could see
And though I'd been a giant born
I'd never had lifted it to my knee

O, wee wee man but thou are strong
Come tell me where thy dwelling be
I dwell beneath a bonny green bower
O, will ye come with me and see?

His beard was long and white as as swan
His robe was neither green nor gray
He clapped his hands, down came the mist
And he sank and he's fainted clean away

He pulled up a stone six feet in height
And flung it farther than I could see
And though I'd been a giant born
I'd never had lifted it to my knee

We rode on and we sped on
Until we came to a bonny green hall
The roof was made of the beaten gold
And purest crystal was the floor

There were pipers playing on every stair
And ladies dancing in glistering green
He clapped his hands, down came the mist
And the man and the hall no more were seen

His beard was long and white as as swan
His robe was neither green nor gray
He clapped his hands, down came the mist
And he sank and he's fainted clean away

He pulled up a stone six feet in height
And flung it farther than I could see
And though I'd been a giant born
I'd never had lifted it to my knee

== The Weaver And The Factory Maid

[verse]
____
Oh, when I was a tailor, I carried my bodkin and shears
When I was a weaver, I carried my roods and my gear
My temples also, my small clothes and reed in my hand
And wherever I go, here's the jolly bold weaver again

I'm a hand weaver to my trade
I fell in love with a factory maid
And if I could but her favour win
I'd stand beside her and weave by steam

My father to me scornful said
"How could you fancy a factory maid?"
When you could have girls fine and gay
Dressed like unto the Queen of May

As for your fine girls I don't care
If I could but enjoy my dear
I'd stand in the factory all the day
And she and I'd keep our shuttles in play

I went to my love's bedroom door
Where often times I had been before
But I could not speak nor yet get in
The pleasant bed that my love lies in

How can you say it's a pleasant bed
When nowt lies there but a factory maid?
And a factory lass although she be
Blest is the man that enjoys she

O pleasant thoughts come to me mind
As I turn down the sheets so fine
And I seen her two breasts standing so
Like two white hills all covered with snow

The loom goes click and the loom goes clack
The shuttle flies forward and then flies back
The weaver's so bent that he's like to crack
Such a wearisome trade is the weaver

The yarn is made into cloth at last
The ends of the weft they are made quite fast
The weaver's labors are now all past
Such a wearisome trade is the weaver

Where are the girls, I will tell you plain
The girls have gone to weave by steam
And if you'd find them you must rise at dawn
And trudge to the mill in the early morn

Oh, when I was a tailor, I carried my bodkin and shears
When I was a weaver, I carried my roods and my gear
My temples also, my small clothes and reed in my hand
And wherever I go, here's the jolly bold weaver again

== Rogues In A Nation

[verse]
____
Farewell to all our Scottish fame
Farewell our ancient glory
Farewell even to our Scottish name
Sae fam'd in martial story

Now Sark runs over the Solway sands
And Tweed runs to the ocean
To mark where England's province stands
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

What force or gile could not subdue
Through many warlike ages
Is wrought now by a coward few
For hireling traitor's wages

The English steel we could disdain

Secure in valor's station
But English gold has been our bane
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

I would or I had seen the day
That treason thus could sell us
My auld gray head had lain in clay
Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace

But pith and power, till my last hour
I'll make this declaration
We were bought and sold for English gold
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

== Cam Ye O'er From France

[verse]
____
Cam ye o'er frae France? Cam ye down by Lunnon?
Saw ye Geordie Whelps and his bonny woman?
Were ye at the place ca'd the Kittle Housie?
Saw ye Geordie's grace riding on a goosie?

Geordie he's a man there is little doubt o't
He's done a' he can, wha can do without it?
Down there came a blade linkin' like my lordie
He wad drive a trade at the loom o' Geordie

Though the claith were bad, blythly may we niffer
Gin we get a wab, it makes little differ
We hae tint our plaid, bannet, belt and swordie
Ha's and mailins braid, but we hae a Geordie

Geordie's gane to France and Montgomery's lady
There they'll learn to dance, Madam, are ye ready?
They'll be back betide belted, brisk and lordly
Brawly may they thrive to dance a jig wi' Geordie

Hey for Sandy Don, hey for Cockolorum
Hey for Bobbing John and his Highland Quorum
Mony a sword and lance swings at Highland hurdie
How they'll skip and dance o'er the bum o' Geordie

== Hares On The Mountain

[verse]
____
Young women they run like hares on the mountain
And if I was a young man I'd soon go a-hunting

Young women they sing like birds in the bushes
If I was a young man I'd go beat them bushes

Young women they swim like ducks in the water

If I was a young man I'd soon go swim after

Young women they run like hares on the mountain
And if I was a young man I'd soon go a-hunting
