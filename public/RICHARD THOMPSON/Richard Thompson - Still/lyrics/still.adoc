== She Never Could Resist A Winding Road

[verse]
____
In the old cold embers of the year
When joy and comfort disappear
I search around to find her
I'm a hundred miles behind her
The open road whispered in her ear

She Never Could Resist a Winding Road
She Never Could Resist a Winding Road
Maybe just around the bend
The rainbow waiting at the end
She Never Could Resist a Winding Road

She never could stay any place too long
To not be standing still's where she belongs
If you love her, better know
She needs you now, but soon she'll go
She never could stay any place too long

It's not that she don't care about you
Say you love her, she don't doubt you
But she can learn to live without you
When she hears the call

Love her now then let her be
Don't tie her down, just set her free
Too many things she wants to see
The whole world, that's all

She Never Could Resist a Winding Road
She Never Could Resist a Winding Road
Maybe just around the bend
The rainbow waiting at the end
She Never Could Resist a Winding Road
She Never Could Resist a Winding Road

== Beatnik Walking

[verse]
____
Hand me down my walking shoes
And Mr. Murdoch's news
I'm going thunder rain or shine
Got a papoose on my back
We're on the right track, Jack
To leave the beatnik blues behind

Amsterdam, where good things come in threes
Ease your troubled mind and shoot the breeze

Take the path down to the mill
I'm going to get my fill
I'm going to eat till the pot runs dry
Anne Frank's house and Rembrandt's tomb
I'd better make some room
â€˜Cause Brother Vincent's on my mind

Life goes on behind the tiles and chintzes
Dirty water fit for kings and princes

Dutch is not a loving tongue
You say your piece and run
You show you care in other ways
Sailors in their Sunday best
I'm feeling overdressed
I've got to lose these blacks and greys

Amsterdam, where good things come in threes
Soothe your troubled mind and shoot the breeze

Hand me down my walking shoes
Hand me down my walking shoes
Got to leave these beatnik blues behind

== Patty Don't You Put Me Down

[verse]
____
Patty don't tell me one thing and change your mind
We might be in bed together but the deal's not signed
They say you collect shrunken heads, would you like to have mine?

Patty Don't You Put Me Down
Don't colour me cruel

You're so used to skimming the ace and palming the jack
The right hand giving and the left hand taking it back
At society functions they probably give you more slack

Patty Don't You Put Me Down
Don't colour me cruel

You can stamp all you want, but this ain't television
I can't fix it all with a small incision
It's a meltdown you're having, not nuclear fission
There's no room service at the seaman's mission

In your ten watt world it's beyond any pleasure you know
To stick your fingers in the socket, and give yourself a glow
Keep that up and they might make you part of the show

Patty Don't You Put Me Down
Don't colour me cruel
____


== Broken Doll

[verse]
____
You called for me so here I am
Not a boy and not a man
Man enough to know the odds are long
They dress you up and keep you clean
Like courtiers around a queen
Show you good from bad, right from wrong

All the tears in the world
All the tears in the world
Won't mend a Broken Doll

The little things in life escape her
Dolls are made of rags and paper
China cracks and chips so easily
Doesn't have the will, the strength
To hold the world out at arm's length
Skin's too thin, eyes too wide to see

All the tears in the world
All the tears in the world
Won't mend a Broken Doll

Wish I could give love to you
And life to you and hope to you
As you look through me to something else
In your face I think I see
Twisted-up infinity
Angel soul imprisoned in a shell

All the tears in the world
All the tears in the world
Won't mend a Broken Doll
____


== All Buttoned Up

[verse]
____
I got a girl - best girl in the world
But she won't give me a taste of it
Saving her bed - maidenhead
That's what I call a waste of it

Crosses her arms - to hide all her charms
Like she's living in a nunnery
Gives me a wink - drive me to drink
I know she's only making fun of me

She's All Buttoned Up
All Buttoned Up, no place to go

She don't mind a squeeze - if I say please
I might even manage a kiss of her
But I'll get a slap - if I sit her on my lap
I call that so remiss of her

She's All Buttoned Up
All Buttoned Up, no place to go

She hates the stuff I bring her
She wants diamonds on her finger
She wouldn't let me in
Frothing at the mouth and barking
On all fours like Rin Tin Tin

My girl Kate - she wants me to wait
But I got urges, don't I?
I got desires - raging fires
But I'll do the right thing, won't I?

She's All Buttoned Up
All Buttoned Up, no place to go

She changes with the weather
She keeps her knees together
But she dresses so racy
Drawing Man into temptation
With everything silky, satiny, lacy

I got a girl - best girl in the world
But she won't give me a taste of it
Saving her bed - maidenhead
That's what I call a waste of it

She's All Buttoned Up
All Buttoned Up, no place to go
She's All Buttoned Up
All Buttoned Up, no place to go
____


== Josephine

[verse]
____
Josephine paces her room
Josephine wishes the stars would appear
Breathless she'll run to her tryst
On the brow of the hill
If God will

Josephine looks for a rose
To perfume the tight angry curls of her hair
He'll come this once, and maybe
Again, but where
Or when

And the leaves blow in
And the leaves blow into the hall

Josephine dresses her wound
One scent of blood and he might disappear
Or maybe he'll want to devour her
Whole and complete
In a heart beat

Josephine talks in her sleep
More friends around her asleep than awake
Cries desolation to phantoms
But nobody hears
A dream's tears

And the leaves blow in
And the leaves blow into the hall

Josephine writes on the wall
Writes all the thoughts that escape from her head
Hundreds and thousands of words
Written small on a wall
That's all
____


== Long John Silver

[verse]
____
Long John Silver, he was on me like a rash
Gave him my trust, gave him my cash
Should have seen through him, should have seen from the start
There's nothing but black in pirate's heart

Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver

Long John Silver, he's good with numbers
He makes hay while other folks slumber
Gives me the brass, and he keeps all the best
The better to feather his pretty little nest

Long John Silver, Long John Silver,
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver

Took all my money, my watch and chain
Crack his head if I see him again
Kind friends, warning take by me
Not every pirate's sailing the sea

Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
Long John Silver, Long John Silver
Don't bet your shirt on Long John Silver
____


== Pony In The Stable

[verse]
____
You're messing with my mind
You're thrilling me but killing me
I'm missing all the signs
You're rushing me and crushing me
Same old same old
Packs of lies and compromises
Same old same old
Pony in the stable

You've got me where it stings
Wrapped around your little finger
Sold off all my things
Begging like a carol singer
Same old same old
Bread and dripping on the table
Same old same old
Pony in the stable

Forgive me if I sneer
You're used to being Cleopatra
You don't like to hear
The stuff you dish out come back at you
Same old same old
Packs of lies and compromises
Same old same old
Pony in the stable

I'm flattered but I'm scared
You picked me out from all the others
Should have been prepared
For friends to parlay into lovers
Same old same old
Bread and dripping on the table
Same old same old
Pony in the stable
____


== Where's Your Heart

[verse]
____
Why so cool
Why so tough
You call all the shots
You strut your stuff

But Where's Your Heart?
Where's Your Heart?
It should be beating right there
Where's Your Heart?

So strange to hear you
Talk about love
Is it just yourself
You're enamored of?

But Where's Your Heart?
Where's Your Heart?
It should be beating right there
Where's Your Heart?

I wish you'd leave
But what good's wishing
You're a puzzle to me
With pieces missing
Where's Your Heart

Did salt tears ever
Leave your eye
Did love ever make you
Wish and sigh?

Where's Your Heart?
Where's Your Heart?
It should be beating right there
Where's Your Heart?
Where's Your Heart?
Where's Your Heart?
____


== No Peace, No End

[verse]
____
Where were you when the walls were crumbling
Where were you when the guns were rumbling
Where were you when the hounds of hell
Took sons and lovers away
Did you see me on the slippery slope
Wrong end of a telescope
Do you even pause for breath
As you sleepwalk through the day

Some day won't you
Stand in my shoes
And see the world I see
No hope no friend
No Peace No End

I'm ground between two stones
Soon I'll be nothing but bones
Who'll be my shining savior
Before I turn to dust?
Are you the hand that kills me?
Are you the hand that saves me?
When they both sell you down the river
Which one can you trust?

Some day won't you
Stand in my shoes
And see the world I see
No hope no friend
No Peace No End
No hope no friend
No Peace No End

In the peace museum there's a mangy dove
To remind us all of universal love
You can rent her out for your corporate dinner
And feel good about yourself
Geneva Convention they use as a pessary
Olive branch is a fashion accessory
In the big chess game there's just one winner
And it's always somebody else

Some day won't you
Stand in my shoes
And see the world I see
No hope no friend
No Peace No End
No hope no friend
No Peace No End
____


== Dungeons For Eyes

[verse]
____
He's smiling at me
The man with the blood on his hands
The man with the snakes in his shoes
Am I supposed to love him?
He's smiling at me
The hero who chained up the dogs
Mephistopheles shorn of his tail
Am I supposed to love him?
Am I supposed to shake his hand?

Souls whisper to me
Souls torn from bodies
Souls lost and wandering
Smile that smile
But eyes don't lie
It's black in there, and bloody
Dungeons for eyes

He's got that smell
The musty old smell of a priest
The damp and mold of neglect
The smell of fresh earth dug over
But how we forgive
Old rivalries half-forgot
We smile as best as we can
But I can't let it go
But I can't let it go
I can't forgive you, I can't forgive me

Souls whisper to me
Souls torn from bodies
Souls lost and wandering
Smile that smile
But eyes don't lie
It's black in there, and bloody
Dungeons for eyes
Dungeons for eyes
____


== Guitar Heroes

[verse]
____
I can't go out with my friends on a Saturday night
My guitar's like a woman and you know I've got to treat her right
I've got to practice all night and day
I've got to play the way my heroes play
I've got to learn how the do it the Django way -

[Melodie Au Crepuscule]

O my teacher says they're going to kick me out of school
â€˜Cause I'm nothing but a bebop, twang-headed rock and roll fool
If I don't do my homework I've got to go
But they can't teach me what I've got to know
How do I make my guitar sound like Les Paul?

[Caravan]

I'll do the washing up later, let me practice if I choose
But how does Chuck Berry make it bounce right out of the grooves?

[Little Queenie]

My girlfriend says she's going to dump me any day soon
If I don't stop strumming my guitar and get out of my room
If I don't get a life she's going to look elsewhere
She says, there's some normal boys out there
I said, I'll catch you up when I've cracked this James Burton tune

[Suzie Q]

My Mum and Dad say they're going to put me out in the street
I'm excommunicated till I get a job and get on my feet
They say I'm not making a contribution
But I'm still searching for a musical solution
I've got to know how the Shadows get that beat

[FBI]

Well I played and I played till my fingers bled
I shut out all the voices but the voice in my head
Now I stand on stage and I do my stuff
And maybe it's good, but it's never good enough
To tell you the truth, I always hid it -
I still don't know how my heroes did it
I still don't know how my heroes did it
Guitar Heroes
Guitar Heroes
