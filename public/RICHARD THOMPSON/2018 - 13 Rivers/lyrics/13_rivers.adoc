== The Storm Won't Come

[verse]
____
I'm longing for a storm to blow through town
And blow these sad old buildings down
Fire to burn what fire might
And rain to wash it all away

But the storm won't come
But the storm won't come
I'm longing for the storm
But the storm won't come

There's a smell of death where I lay my head
So I'll go to the storm instead
I'll seek it out and stand in the rain
Thunder and lightning, and I'll scream my name

But it's never the same
But it's never the same
The storm must come to me
And the storm won't come

But a leaf is stuck, the dust is blowing
There is no storm so I'll make my own
Paint up the walls and I'll buy what's rotten
Throw out all the old and the half-forgotten

But I'm not as strong
But I'm not as strong
As the wind and the rain
And the storm won't come

But the storm won't come
The storm won't come
I'm longing for the storm
But the storm won't come

== The Rattle Within

[verse]
____
Oh, holy man save you from a dance with the Devil
Jesus save you from the bottle of gin
Voodoo save you from a sleepwalk woman
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

Well, that voice might come when you're taking your pleasure
The voice might come when you're resting your bones
Seek you out when you're sad or smiling
Drags you down when you think you're alone

[Chorus:]
Just when you think that your horses are running
Just when you think that you're fixing to win
There's that wandering deep inside you
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Save me, save me, save me
From the rattle within

He wears your shirt and he wears your shoes
He's living right there inside your skin
You've got notions, he's got notions
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

Well, a man's made of muscle
And he's gonna wrestle
But when he gets weary, he ain't gonna win
Who's gonna save you when the tank is empty?
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

[Chorus:]
Ah, just when you think that your horses are ready
Just when you think that you're fixing to win
There's that wandering deep inside you
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Save me, save me, save me
From the rattle within

Well, holy man save you from a dance with the Devil
Jesus save you from the bottle of gin
Voodoo save you from a sleepwalk woman
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?
Who's gonna save you from the rattle within?

== Her Love Was Meant For Me

[verse]
____
Gypsy fang twists my love life
She's my soul and destiny
Three times I turned the queen of hearts
But her love was meant for me

Cupid shoots just like a baby
Her Romeo won't let her be
Shoot them darts in my direction
Her love was meant for me

[Chorus:]
As a kid, I saw rainbows
But life, it turns you upside down
It shakes the money out of your Wranglers
Leave you heaving on the ground

Oh I've followed all the prophecies
From sea to shining sea
She came to me walking backwards
Her love was meant for me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]
Now she's mine, I plan to keep her
So put your eyes back in their sockets
Your holes of the upholstery
Put your hands back in their pockets

Oh she doesn't look at you, brother
The way she looks at me
Like a razor through a scarecrow
Her love was meant for me

[Instrumental]

Don't need a ticket for the future
The apocalypse is free
Armageddon's in the mirror
Her love was meant for me (love was meant for me)
Her love was meant for me
____

== Bones Of Gilead

[verse]
____
What's my name? My name is Trouble
Trouble of the tender kind
From the ruin, from the rubble
I will rise like London pride

No checkpoint will stop me
There is no plan
Like an earthquake, I'll rock you
Run if you can

By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead

What's my name? My name is Heartbreak
Heartbreak of the giving kind
I will come and whisper sweetness
Sweetness that will dawn your mind

No ribcage can hold me
No loving cup
I don't fit your wise world
I tear it up

By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead

What's my name? Just call me Micah
Micah like the Bible says
I can't help it, it's within me
Runes are written on my face

False prophets accuse me
Their days are few
I heal all before me
I will heal you

By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
By the flesh of Gilead
By the bones of Gilead
____

== The Dog In You

[verse]
____
It's not love that you're looking for
It's not love that you're hunting down
You're just on the train of the innocent, the frail
And you're gonna rob them

You don't mind causing pain
Or who you drive insane
Those timebombs explode years down the road
But that's not your problem

[Chorus:]
All of the pain
Again and again
To put a twinkle in your eye
All the grief
To give you some relief
And to satisfy the dog in you

Please don't say "That's the way God made me"
Please don't say "I can't help who I am"
You can't justify, you're beyond any measure
Just I get your pleasure

[Chorus:]
All the pain
Again and again
To put a twinkle in your eye
All the grief
Just to give you some relief
And to satisfy the dog in you
The dog in you
The dog in you
____

== Trying

[verse]
____
What kind of breeze do you think you are?
You bend me 'til I break
And what kind of dance did you drag me to?
Like a Baptist, I moan and shake

[Pre-Chorus:]
If I should fall, fall off the shelf
I'm only trying to be true to myself
To be true

[Chorus:]
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Well, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I

[Post-Chorus:]
I thought I could fake forever
But I was wrong
I thought I could wait forever
I thought I was strong
Can't put on the brake forever
Forever's too long
You shake me 'til I don't know right from
Right from wrong

And what kind of house are you building for me?
The sand shifts under my feet
And what kind of pill did you slip in my tea?
The bitter taste, so sweet

[Pre-Chorus:]
If I should fall, fall off the shelf
I'm only trying to be true to myself
To be true

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
Well, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I

[Post-Chorus:]
I thought I could fake forever
But I was wrong
I thought I could wait forever
I thought I was strong
Can't put on the brake forever
Forever's too long
You shake me 'til I don't know right from
Right from wrong
Right from wrong
Right from wrong

== Do All These Tears Belong To You

[verse]
____


Holdin', lovin', sharin', kissin'
Hauntin', hurtin', tearin', missin'
Losing love and losing love again

Fakin', fakin', sometimes break
Searchin', longin', hiding', wonderin'
Somewhere there's a face, and there's a name

We could end it right away
We could wish our lives away
We could twist the night away
Oh, could look into above
Pretend it's all just a dream
But I've never seen two eyes so green
Or see it back so black and blue
Do all these tears belong to you?

Wishin', dreamin', bumpin', schemin'
Longin', yearnin', never turnin'
Somewhere, out there, there's a part of you

Fightin', knowin', laughin', rollin'
Weepin', spillin' tears for feelin'
All the pieces of the dream came true

We could end it right away
We could wish our lives away
We could twist the night away
Oh, could look into above
Pretend it's all just a dream
Oh, I've never seen two eyes so green
Or see it back so black and blue
Do all these tears belong to you?
Do all these tears belong to you?
____

== My Rock, My Rope

[verse]
____


In my pain, in my darkness
Is my comfort and hope
In my loss and in my sorrow
Is my rock, is my rope

Oh give me the strength to bear it
Oh give me the strength to seek
But this is not forever
But what must be, must be

In my cloud of illusion
Give me somewhere I can steer
Through the shores and the shipwrecks
Till I see my way is clear

Or let me be uplifted
Or take this away from me
And hear me from my demons
And forever I'll be free

In my pain and in my darkness
Is my comfort and hope
In my loss and in my sorrow
Is my rock and my rope

Is my rock
Is my rock
Is my rock
Is my rock
____

== You Can't Reach Me

[verse]
____
I can reach you but you can't reach me
Not a damn thing that you can teach me
Get my education direct
Direct from up above

I take on board the bits that fit
The war and Armageddon 'n' shit
I did show them mercy and kindness
[?] kindness and peace and love

You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold

The way I see it, the world's not fair
I don't fit here and I don't fit there
I was born not belonging to one thing
To one thing or the other

But I found a rock that I can cling to
I found a flock that I can sing to
Corner of the world and here they call me
Here they call me "Brother"

You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold

Don't give me that innocent stuff
Don't give me that line
There's guilt in everything that you do
You're guilty all of the time

You think I'm one of you but I've got things cooking
I hide in the open right where you're looking
You know what I come here for
Well, I'm knocking on your door

You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
You can't reach me
I'm out in the cold
____

== O Cinderella

[verse]
____
I've been drifting along with a skeleton crew
[?] O'Grady, [I'm?] blackjack and Willie McGrew
But I run into top of the day [after?] running you

I thought you was looking for money stuffed under the bed
You were talking to the mirror, I thought you was gone in the head
But you were just saying Hail Marys to comfort the dead

[Chorus:]
O Cinderella, your rags are so sheik
Did they come off the peg at your favorite boutique?
Could you please spare the time to run an old [tire?] up the creek?
Well I hope that you're listening, I'm stating my case
I say it again 'til I'm blue in the face
O Cinderella, I'm not very house-trained, it's true
But I want to make cupcakes with you

O Cinderella, you run like I'm Jack the Ripper
Won't you trade up your rags and slide your foot in the slipper?
You're working-class cool, but a glass slipper is hipper

[Chorus:]
O Cinderella, your rags are so sheik
Did they come off the peg at your favorite boutique?
Could you please spare the time to run an old [tire?] up the creek?
Oh I hope that you're listening, I'm stating my case
I say it again 'til I'm blue in the face
O Cinderella, I'm not very house-trained, it's true
But I want to dust cobwebs with you
Cobwebs with you
I want to dust cobwebs with you
____

== No Matter

[verse]
____
No matter what you say, I believe
I don't see [?] up your sleep
Can't you see me smile?
Just the shadow of a frown?
Even if wanting you would tear my mansion down

No matter what you say, my head's in the sink
Born yesterday, I don't think
I've seen it all before
Love [left is burnt?]
Contemplating suicide before the tide has turned

[Bridge:]
And I can [/can't] leave my life like Shakespeare on the run
Some lads are [?] [soliloquies?] won't come

[Chorus:]
I'm living on fantasy
Real life's too good for me
Let me disappear from here
And be no one

No matter what you say, do you need me?
Doesn't mean you'll stay, doesn't mean that you'll leave
'Cause every body bleeds
And everybody cries
Now it's time for bandages and rags to dry our eyes

[Chorus:]
I'm living on fantasy
Real life's too good for me
Let me disappear from here
And be no one

[Outro:]
No matter what you say, I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
____

== Pride

[verse]
____
What would you do if I pricked your balloon?
Would you burst into tears and run to your room?
Or say it's just once in a very blue moon
Would you be aware you were leaking air?
Would you know some bitch of a witch somewhere?
Who's sticking pins in you, pins in you?

[Chorus 1:]
Pride won't let you walk away
Without blood on your fists
Pride won't let you walk away
'Til you've ticked off your list
Come on baby, strut your stuff
[?] 'cause you're tough enough
'Til pride is satisfied and we can all go home

When you're [?] like you it's hard to be humble
You never think twice, you never stumble
The seeds of doubt, they never rumble
Vanity! Vanity! All is vanity!
Do you feel something for the rest of humanity?
We can't live up to you, up to you, up to you

[Chorus 2:]
Pride won't let you walk away
Without blood on your fists
Pride won't let you walk away
'Til you've ticked off your list
You look so majestic standing there
With the playful breeze blowing in your hair
'Til pride is satisfied and we can all go home

Show 'em what's wrong, show 'em how to do it
They fluffed it, they muffed it, they scuffed it, they blew it
The spanner's in the works and you know who threw it
A coupon short of a toaster there
Will you use your wit or your famous stare
To write the symphony, infamy, infamy?

[Chorus 1:]
Pride won't let you walk away
Without blood on your fists
Pride won't let you walk away
'Til you've ticked off your list
Come on baby, strut your stuff
[?] 'cause you're tough enough
'Til pride is satisfied and we can all go home
____

== Shaking The Gates

[verse]
____
If angels are real then who needs dreams?
I think I'll never close my eyes again
If my feet betray me lock the door
My heart may never be this wise again

[Chorus:]
I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the gates of hell

[Bridge:]
I used to hold the world, it turned to gold
Now everything that moved me has grown cold

If life is forever then I'm your man
Devil was inclined to [pine away?]
Echoes and shadows are my [wall?]
All I've done is lead myself astray

[Chorus:]
I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the gates of hell

If angels are real then who needs dreams?
I think I'll never close my eyes again

[Chorus:]
I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the gates of hell
I'm shaking
I'm shaking
I'm shaking the gates of hell
