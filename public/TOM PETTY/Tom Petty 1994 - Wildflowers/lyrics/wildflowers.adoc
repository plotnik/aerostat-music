== Wildflowers

[verse]
____
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
I have seen no other
Who compares with you

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worry
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free

== You Don't Know How It Feels

[verse]
____
Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
Let's head on down the road
There's somewhere I gotta go
And you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road
There's somewhere I got to go
And you don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me

== Time To Move On

[verse]
____
It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
She's an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector

Broken skyline, which way to love land
Which way to something better
Which way to forgiveness
Which way do I go

Time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Sometime later, getting the words wrong
Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenaline
Like breakin' up a dogfight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time
I'm losing my mind

It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going 
____

== You Wreck Me

[verse]
____
Tonight we ride, right or wrong
Tonight we sail, on a radio song
Rescue me, should I go down
If I stay too long in trouble town

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
You break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

Now and again I get the feeling
Well if I don't win, I'm a gonna break even
Rescue me, should I go wrong
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
You break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants
You be the girl at the high school dance
Run with me, wherever I go
Just play dumb, whatever you know

Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
You break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

== It's Good To Be King

[verse]
____
It's good to be king, if just for a while
To be there in velvet, yeah, to give 'em a smile
It's good to get high and never come down
It's good to be king of your own little town

Yeah, the world would swing if I were king
Can I help it if I still dream time to time

It's good to be king and have your own way
Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day
And when your bulldog barks and your canary sings
You're out there with winners, it's good to be king

Yeah I'll be king when dogs get wings
Can I help it if I still dream time to time

It's good to be king and have your own world
It helps to make friends, it's good to meet girls
A sweet little queen who can't run away
It's good to be king, whatever it pays

Excuse me if I have some place in my mind
Where I go time to time 
____


== Only A Broken Heart

[verse]
____
Here comes that feeling I've seen in your eyes
Back in the old days, before the hard times
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

I know the place where you keep your secrets
Out of the sunshine, down in a valley
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

What would I give, to start all over again
To clean up my mistakes

Stand in the moonlight, stand under heaven
Wait for an answer, hold out forever
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

What would I give, to start all over again
To clean up my mistakes

I know your weakness, you've seen my dark side
The end of the rainbow is always a long ride
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart 
____


== Honey Bee

[verse]
____
Come on now, give me some sugar
Give me some sugar, little honey bee
Don't be afraid, not gonna hurt you
I wouldn't hurt my little honey bee

Don't say a word, 'bout what we're doin'
Don't say nothin' little honey bee
Don't tell your momma, don't tell your sister
Don't tell your boyfriend, little honey bee

She like to call me king bee
She like to buzz 'round my tree
I call her honey bee
I'm a man in a trance
I'm a boy in short pants
When I see my honey bee
And I've got something to say

Look here now, peace in the valley
Peace in the valley with my honey bee
Don't say a word, 'bout what we're doin'
Don't say nothin' little honey bee

She give me her monkey hand
And a Rambler sedan
I'm the king of Milwaukee
Her juju beads are so nice
She kissed my third cousin twice
I'm the king of Pomona
And I've got something to say 
____


== Don't Fade On Me

[verse]
____
I remember you so clearly
The first one through the door
I return to find you drifting
Too far from the shore

I remember feeling this way
You can lose it without knowing
You wake up and you don't notice
Which way the wind is blowing

Don't fade
Don't fade on me

You were the one who made things different
You were the one who took me in
You were the one thing I could count on
Above all you were my friend

Don't fade
Don't fade on me

Well your clothes hang on a wire
And the sun is overhead
But today you are too weary
To even leave your bed

Was it love that took you under?
Or did you know too much?
Was it something you could picture?
But never could quite touch?

Don't fade
Don't fade on me 
____


== Hard On Me

[verse]
____
It's all I can do
To keep that little girl smiling
And keep my faith alive
Takes all I got to hold on to tomorrow

And you want to make it hard
Yeah, you want to make it hard on me

Some other time
I'd be understanding
You were supposed to be
The friend that I needed when I was down and now

You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me

Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be

Now you want to make it hard
Yeah, you want to make it hard on me

Maybe if I tried, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be

I need someone
To put their arm around me
Shelter me from all harm
Just as I find something to believe in

You want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me
Yeah, you want to make it hard
You want to make it hard on me

== Cabin Down Below

[verse]
____
Come on go with me, babe
Come on go with me, girl
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

I got a radio
Put it on soft and low
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

Well, I've had my eye on you
For a long, long time
I'm watching everything you do
Baby, you're gonna be mine

Come on go with me, babe
Come on go with me, girl
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

Time's been moving slow
Since we both got here
Come on slide a little closer
Let me whisper in your ear

Well I got a radio
Turn it on soft and low
Baby, let's go
To the cabin down below

Oh, baby, let's go
To the cabin down below
Baby, let's love
In the cabin down below

== To Find A Friend

[verse]
____
In the middle of his life
He left his wife
And ran off to be bad
Boy, it was sad
But he bought a new car
Found a new bar
And went under another name
Created a whole new game

And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed, then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend

Meanwhile then
His wife's boyfriend moved in and
Took over the house
Everybody was quiet as a mouse
And it changed their lives
Changed their plans
Slowly they grew apart
Boy, it woulda broke your heart

And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed, then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend 
____

== A Higher Place

[verse]
____
We gotta get to a higher place
And we gotta leave by night
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find some place that's dry
We gotta run like we've never run
Or we're gonna lose the light

If we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more

Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I've got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor

But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together
We gotta get to a higher place
If we want to survive the weather

I remember walking with her in town
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again
When I add up what I've left behind
I don't want to lose no more

But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more

== House In The Woods

[verse]
____
I'm goin' down to the house in the woods
See my little darlin'
I'm goin' down, out in the fields
With summertime comin'

Oh my love, what can I do
What can I do but love you?
For the rest of my days, the rest of my nights
What can I do but love you?

Summertime falls on the house in the woods
Back by the power lines
I ain't got a neighbor for nine or ten miles
Back in the tall pines

And hey, now baby, what can I do?
What am I goin' to do but trust you?
The rest of my nights, the rest of my days
What can I do but love you?

Hey now baby, what can I do?
What am I goin' to do but love you
For the rest of my days, the rest of my nights
What could I do but love you?
____


== Crawling Back To You

[verse]
____
Waiting by the side of the road
For day to break so we could go
Down into Los Angeles
With dirty hands and worn out knees

I keep crawling back to you
I keep crawling back to you

The ranger came with burning eyes
The chambermaid awoke surprised
Thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head and let him in

Hey baby, there's something in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do

It was me and my sidekick
He was drunk and I was sick
We were caught up in a barroom fight
Till an Indian shot out the lights

I'm so tired of being tired
Sure as night will follow day
Most things I worry about
Never happen anyway

I keep crawling back to you
I keep crawling back to you
____


== Wake Up Time

[verse]
____
You follow your feelings, you follow your dreams
You follow the leader into the trees
And what's in there waiting, neither one of us knows
You gotta keep one eye open the further you go
You never dreamed you'd go down on one knee, but now
Who could have seen, you'd be so hard to please somehow
You feel like a poor boy, a long way from home
You're just a poor boy, a long way from home

And it's wake up time
Time to open your eyes
And rise and shine

You spend your life dreaming, running 'round in a trance
You hang out forever and still miss the dance
And if you get lucky, you might find someone
To help you get over the pain that will come
Yeah, you were so cool back in high school, what happened
You were so sure not to have your spirits dampened
But you're just a poor boy alone in this world
You're just a poor boy alone in this world

And it's wake up time
Time to open your eyes
And rise and shine

Well, if he gets lucky, a boy finds a girl
To help him to shoulder the pain in this world
And if you follow your feelings
And you follow your dreams
You might find the forest there in the trees
Yeah, you'll be alright, it's just gonna take time, but now
Who could have seen you'd be so hard to please somehow
You're just a poor boy a long way from home
You're just a poor boy a long way from home

And it's wake up time
Time to open your eyes
And rise and shine

'Cause it's wake up time
It's time to open your eyes
And rise and shine
