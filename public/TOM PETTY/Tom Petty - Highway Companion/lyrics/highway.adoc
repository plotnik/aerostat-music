== Saving Grace

[verse]
____
I'm passing sleeping cities
Fading by degrees
Not believing all I see to be so

I'm flyin' over backyards
Country homes and ranches
Watching life between the branches below

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you baby?

You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace

I'm moving on alone over ground that no one owns
Past statues that atone for my sins
There's a guard on every door
And a drink on every floor
Overflowing with a thousand amens

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you baby?

You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace
Don't you baby?

You're rolling up the carpet
Of your father's two-room mansion
No headroom for expansion no more
And there's a corner of the floor
They're telling you is yours
You're confident but not really sure

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you baby?

You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace

Don't you baby?

You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace

Don't you baby?

== Square One

[verse]
____
Had to find some higher ground.
Had some fear to get around.
You can say what you don't know.
Later on won't work no more.

Last time through I hid my tracks.
So well I could not get back.
Yeah my way was hard to find.
Can't sell your soul for peace of mind.

[Chorus:]
Square one, my slate is clear.
Rest your head on me my dear.
It took a world of trouble, took a world of tears.
It took a long time to get back here.

Tried so hard to stand alone.
Struggled to see past my nose.
Always had more dogs than bones.
I could never wear those clothes.

It's a dark victory.
You won and you are so lost.
Told us you were satisfied, but it never came across.

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2x]

== Flirting With Time

[verse]
____
A coyote ran across the road
On the move without a home.
A flash of light reminded me of you.
This could well be your last stand.
Hold the sunlight in your hand.
Spread your fingers, feel the sand fall through.
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.

[Chorus:]
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, but maybe,
Time baby, is catching up with you.

Shadowmen talk a real good game.
Every punchline has your name.
You cried out and no one came to you.
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.

[Chorus]

Should be more to learn from this.
Can't say I know what it is.
No difference tween a hit or miss,
It's true.
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.

[Chorus 2x]

== Down South

[verse]
____
Headed back down south
Gonna see my daddy's mistress
Gonna buy back her forgivness
Pay off every witness

One more time down south
Sell the family headstones
Drag a bag of dry bones
Make good on my back loans

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more

Sleep late down south
Look up my former mentors
Live off yankee winters
Be a landlord and a renter

Create myself down south
Impress all the women
Pretend I'm samuel clemens
Wear seersucker and white linens

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more

Spanish moss down south
Spirits cross the dead fields
Mosquitoes hit the windshield
All document remain sealed

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more

I'll give you all I have
And a little more

== Jack

[verse]
____
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
Trouble came right away, now you say she's gone to stay.
Cough it up, hit the street, left without a word to me.
Oh Oh, you don't know, how that girl could touch my soul.

You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.

Suddenly you know my name, say there's only me to blame.
It's gonna rain, it's gonna shine, gotta stay between the lines.
Rollin down a lonely road, you say I should let it go.
Wish you would come on down, if you need I'll come around.

You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.

Used to have a son named Joe, where he gone to I don't know.
Maybe down in Mexico, livin off of Pattie's door.
If you give me half a chance, I will make her sing and dance.
I'm gonna give her all my soul, I'm gonna play her Rock'n Roll.

You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.

== Turn This Car Around

[verse]
____
Save a dream for me
Words hang in the air
Her demons take the dare
Above the lonely feather circles to the ground
The house don't make a sound

Turn this car around [2x]
I'm goin' back

Green and gray and auburn
Gliding down the sky
The devil winks an eye
A figure in the doorway
Shouldering the blame
This ain't without a name

Turn this car around [2x]
I'm goin' back [repeats]

Yeah... Hey

The king and queen are loaded
Falling off to sleep
The ground begins to creep
Rockets in the tail lights
Red burns into night
Rolling out of sight

Turn this car around [2x]
I'm goin' back

Turn this car around [2x]
I'm goin' back
____

== Big Weekend

[verse]
____
There's some friends that I know
Living in this town and I've come far to see them.
Gonna track em' down.
They live in a brick house painted white and brown.

Left a tip for the maid and I packed up my guitar,
Dropped my key on the counter, rented a car.
Gonna hook up with em' later and go hit the bars.

I need a big weekend. Kick up the dust.
Yeah a big weekend.
If you don't run, you rust.

Well I may shake your hand but I won't know your name.
The joke in your language don't come out the same.
There's times when I'm down and there's nothing to blame.

I need a big weekend.
Kick up the dust.
Yeah a big weekend.
If you don't run, you rust.

I can work, I can travel, sleep anywhere,
Cross every border with nothing to declare.
You can look back babe, but it's best not to stare.

I need a big weekend.
Kick up the dust.
Yeah a big weekend.
If you don't run, you rust.

== Night Driver

[verse]
____
There's a shadow on the moon tonight
I swear I see your face up there with the satellites
Looking down from outer space
Me, I'm drifting home again
Headlights in my eyes
Fighting sleep with windows down
Worn out from long goodbyes.

Night driver drifting home again [2x]

You offered up no history when you blew into town
You remain a mystery, no information found I speed dial the judgment call
The near miss hits the ground
The new king hides behind the throne refusing to be crowned.

Night driver drifting home again [2x]

High tide rumbles, pch
My tires losing track
Helicopter circling, wiping overhead
Now I sit and count the days and try to fill my time
There's a shadow on the moon tonight
The dollar gets a dime.

Night driver drifting home again [2x]

Home Again

== Damaged By Love

[verse]
____
She don't care about time
Time gets in her way
Fades into the wind
Days roll into days
She's got nothing to hide
And she hides it so well
Keeps broken dreams
To fix up and sell

Damaged by love
Damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love

There's rain on the road
And the faithful have gone
In a crowd all alone
Walking 'round in a song

Damaged by love
Damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love

Eyes down at my door
And she holds out her hand
I love you so deep
But you can't understand

Damaged by love
Damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love
____

== This Old Town

[verse]
____
Living free is gaining on me
Can't keep ahead of my dreams
My relief turned out a thief
Smooth as rocks in the stream

This old time is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think

Lazy Jim took a bottle with him
Tried to flag down a train
Left a note
Couldn't read what he wrote
A light came on in my brain

This old time is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think

The hills are gold
Mornings are cold
Don't know a soul on the street
I keep to myself like everyone else
Nobody says much to me

Go to bed, fight thoughts in my head
In the two in between wake and sleep
Rats to kill, contracts to fill
It's on ice, but it won't keep

This old time is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think

This old time is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think

== Ankle Deep

[verse]
____
Well, they raised that horse to be a jumper
He was owned by a mid-west bible thumper
His preacher was a Louisiana drummer
Took all winter to get through the summer

The fieldhand hit the switch and stumbled
Outside the big engine roared and rumbled
The stolen horse spooked and tumbled
She didn't speak for a week
Just kinda mumbled

Ankle deep in love [4x]

He was caught up in a lie he half believed
Found her hiding high in the family tree
Washed his hands and put her cross his knee
She said daddy "you been a mother to me"

Ankle deep in love [4x]
____

== The Golden Rose

[verse]
____
Well, The Golden Rose sailed with a broken man
Going south
Got on board with a woman to lead him around
By the mouth

[Chorus:]
And it's goodbye, Golden Rose
Yeah, it's goodbye, Golden Rose

Well, the captain who swears if he speaks at all
Wears a gun
Got a first maid who's never quite on the ball
For his son

[Chorus]

Wish I was back in her arms again
Wish I was holding her tight
Wish I was back in her arms again
Safe from the night

She stood on the shore and she waved to me:
"Come back home"
Many a-night I would think of her
All alone

[Chorus]
____

== Home

[verse]
____
Left town in a hurry
Blackmailed the judge and the jury
Had his fingers into too many pies
You'll spill honey
You're gonna get flies

Can't begin to remember
You were so tore down by December
Sailed a dry river over the falls
Sometimes everything is nothing at all

And tonight I settle down easy
Beneath this big sky dome
Times are strange
and my mind could change
But honey your arms
Feel like home

I was born in October
Turned the hourglass over
My hair was dripping
My shirt was stained
Hit the ground running
Shackled and chained

And tonight I settle down easy
Beneath this big sky dome
Times are strange
and my mind could change
But honey your arms
Feel like home

Built a fallout shelter
But the storm began to melt her
Drug my bucket
Out into the rain
If I don't say nothin'
I can't complain

And tonight I settle down easy
Beneath this big sky dome
Times are strange
and my mind could change
But honey your arms
Feel like home
____

== Around The Roses

[verse]
____
Got a feeling I'm wrong.
Got a feeling the joke's on me.
Thought that you were my friend.
Around the roses again. Around the roses again.

Don't stare into the sun.
I'm left here with a smoking gun.
Right back where I've been.
Around the roses again. Around the roses again.

[CHORUS:]
Here we go around again.
Never lose but don't quite win.
All I want is to believe in you.

[repeat chorus]

Got a feeling she's gone.
Like my faith has been over run.
Ain't no truth to defend.
Around the roses again. Around the roses again.

Around the roses again.
Around the roses again.
