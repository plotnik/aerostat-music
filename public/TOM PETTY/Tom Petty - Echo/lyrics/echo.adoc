== Room At The Top

[verse]
____
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I can see everything tonight
I got a room where everyone
Can have a drink and forget those things
That went wrong in their life

I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
And I ain't comin' down, I ain't comin' down

I got someone who loves me tonight
I got over a thousand dollars in the bank
And I'm all right
Look deep in the eyes of love
Look deep in the eyes of love
And find out what you were looking for

I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
And I ain't comin' down, no I ain't comin' down

I wish I could feel you tonight, little one
You're so far away
I wanna reach out and touch your heart
Yeah like they do in those things on TV, I love you
Please love me, I'm not so bad
And I love you so

I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
I got a room at the top of the world tonight
And I ain't comin' down, no I ain't comin' down
I ain't comin' down

I want you to be my power glide
Oh, oh, oh, little girl, don't misunderstand me

Well I saw your reflection in the river
And I swear I heard you in the wind
Oh, oh, oh, little girl, don't misunderstand me

I remember when you were his dog
I remember you under his thumb
Yeah baby, when he would call
Every time, you had to come

Hey, baby, you're a free girl now
Hey, baby, you're a free girl now

I remember when he was your boss
I remember him touching your butt
I remember you counting your blessings
Yeah honey, you had to keep your mouth shut

Hey baby, you're a free girl now
Yeah baby, you're a free girl now

Yeah, well all right
Honey, put your sugar down
Dazzle, dazzle the moon above
Lay your victim down

No longer will you be a slave
No longer will you have to crawl
No longer will you suffer
No longer will you stall
One day you'll live for a reason
One day you'll be gone, no more
When you walk from the table
No longer, will you bow down

Lost in the world
Got love in her eyes for me

Outside the law
But you are all I need

== Swingin'

[verse]
____
Well, she was standing by the highway
In her boots and silver spurs
Gonna hitchhike to the yellow moon
When a Cadillac stopped for her
And she said, "Hey, nice to meet you, are you goin' my way?"
Yeah, that's when it happened
The world caught fire that day

And she went down swingin'
Yeah, she went down swingin'

Well, she was over twenty-one
In trouble with the law
And it didn't faze her none
She called her mother-in-law
And said I need a little money
I knew I could count on you
After that night in Vegas
And the hell that we went through

We went down swingin'
Like Benny Goodman
Yeah, we went down swingin'

Moonlight on the interstate
She was 'cross the Georgia line
Looked out the window feeling great
Yeah, it had to come in time
And she said I'm never goin' back
She said at last I'm free
I wish ma could see me now, she'd be so proud of me

She went down swingin'
Like Glenn Miller
Yeah, she went down swingin'
Like Tommy Dorsey
Yeah, she went down swingin'
Like Sammy Davis
She went down swingin'
Like Sonny Liston

== Accused of Love

[verse]
____
You speak to me in natural harmony
Like we both grew up with nothin'
And I can't believe my own memory
But it one day could be coming

And I don't even know the wrong I've done
And I don't even care anymore
All I know is I believe that you and me
Forever will stand accused of love

Watched the sun go down behind London Town
I was burnt, stood up in Mayfair
I caught a train, black car through the rain
From the trust that hung betrayed there

And I don't even know the wrong I've done
And I don't even care anymore
All I know is I believe that you and me
Forever will stand accused of love

Well, the attorney grins, the witness is drug in
With his face half hid in shadow
Sworn to God and State the truth arrives too late
And defense goes out the window

And we don't even know the wrong we've done
And we don't even care anymore
All I know is I believe that you and me
Forever will stand accused of love
Will stand accused of love
Will stand accused of love
____

== Echo

[verse]
____
Put down your things and rest awhile
You know we've both nowhere to go
Yeah, daddy had to crash
He was always halfway there you know
And no, I don't pretend there's any more of that
They say one day, you'll look up and laugh and hear

The same sad echo when you walk
Yeah, the same sad echo when you talk loud and clear
It's the same as the same sad echo around here

I promise you this winter
I will worship you like gold
And ride your train forever
Electric fortunes to be told
And I don't want to question or even celebrate
All the joy you took and then gave back too late

It's the same sad echo when you lie
It's the same sad echo when you try to be clear
It's the same as the same sad echo around here

Well, I woke up right here
In a pool of sweat
With a box of pills and you
Yeah, and I'm gonna keep my head
I'm gonna keep my cool
Oh, I'm so in love with you
Yes and in another world nothing was like this
There may have been a girl
There never was a kiss

The poison came in liquid
She was naked all the time
And no one could explain it
It was all between the lines
And I don't seem to trust anyone no more
It could be faith I'm just not sure

It's the same sad echo every day
Yeah the same sad echo another way
When you call
It's the same as the same sad echo most of all

Well you just got tired
You just gave in
You took it hard
Then you just quit
You let me down
You dropped the ball
You fell on your face most of all
And I don't want to mean anything to you
I don't want to tempt you to be true

It's the same sad echo comin' down
It's the same sad echo all around in my ears
It's the same as the same sad echo around here
____

== Won't Last Long

[verse]

Over this ground before

Oh it's hard to watch you go

I'm down but it won't last long
I'm down but it won't last long

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down like this

It's not the same
Over and over
Over and over again
Yeah, this is not my day

I'm down but it won't last long
I'm down but it won't last long

Half my brain has gone away
Half my brain has gone
So far away

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down again

I'm hurt and you won't let me in
Yeah, this is not my day

I'm down but it won't last long

== Billy The Kid

[verse]
____
Well I heard you in the back room
Your friends had a laugh on me
Passed my name through the cantina
Yeah your face was hard to read
Something in your demeanor
Should of given you away
But I was desperate for a friend
I was getting used to making mistakes

Well I went down hard
Like Billy the Kid
Yeah, I went down hard
Yeah, but I got up again

I remember you my baby
I remember you so well
And your house out in the suburbs
You had your wishing well
They say be careful who you believe
Be careful who you trust
Did you smile when you pulled the trigger
That dropped me in the dust

Well, I went down hard
Like Billy the Kid
Yeah, I went down hard
Yeah, but I got up again

Well, you caught me in the bedroom
Cotton fever in a sweat
I was fighting for recovery
But I wasn't giving up yet
You offered no assistance
Yeah, you looked at me and you lied
Oh it really stunned me
When you went to the other side

I went down hard
Like Billy the Kid
Yeah, I went down hard
Oh, but I got up again

Well this one I'll keep here in my heart

And you don't even know what you want
'Til it's walking away

== No More

[verse]
____
No more
No more
I ain't gonna do it no more
It used to be a big deal
But, I ain't gonna do it
If it ain't real

Big money
Big plans
You stand with a ticket in your hand
You don't play you can't win
But, I ain't gonna do it

When I see that sun go down
My mind begins to clear
Sure was a hard time
It sure was a hard time my dear

== About To Give Out

[verse]
____
Rickey and Dickey
Standing in the sun
Out there on that highway and the dog wouldn't run
Rickey rolled a number
Dickey raised the hood
Time we hit Daytona I was feeling pretty good

Oh, mama I'm about to give out
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm Davey Crockett in a coonskin town
Oh, mama I'm about to give out

Karaoke Katie drove the crowd wild
Every time she'd sing they'd come in for miles
Curtain came up
Katie came on
Drinking like a lumberjack
And singing Delta Dawn

Oh, mama I'm about to give out
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm Davey Crockett in a coonskin town
Oh, mama I'm about to give out

Yeah, I hit town hard last night
Abraham and Moses
Some other friends of mine
Moses started drinkin' he got a little rude
We woke up in the bushes
Beat to Hell and nude

Oh, mama I'm about to give out
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm Davey Crockett in a coonskin town
Oh, mama, I'm about to give out
I'm Roy Rogers in a one horse town
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm about to give out
I'm about to give out

== Rhino Skin

[verse]
____
You need rhino skin
If you're gonna begin
To walk
Through this world
You need elephant balls
If you don't want to crawl
On your hands
Through this world

Oh my love if I reveal
Every secret I've concealed
How many thoughts would you steal
How much of my pain would you feel

You need eagles wings
To get over things
That make no sense
In this world

You need rhino skin
If you're gonna pretend
You're not hurt by this world

If you listen long enough
You can hear my skin grow tough
Love is painful to the touch
Must be made of stronger stuff

You need rhino skin
To get to the end
Of the maze through this world

You need rhino skin
Or you're gonna give in
To the needles and pins
The arrows of sin
The evils of men
You need rhino skin
____

== One More Day, One More Night

[verse]
____
One more night, God I've had to fight
To keep my line of sight on what's real
One more day I fear I've lost my way
I don't know how to say what I feel
Someone better hurry I'm all alone
And I keep breaking down
Breaking down, you know?
No one ever taught me to be on my own
And I keep breaking down
Breaking down, you know?

One more night my eyes reflect the light
In the distance something bright appears
One more day it's too hard to explain
What goes on in my brain is not clear

Someone better hurry I'm all alone
And I keep breaking down
Breaking down, you know?
No one ever taught me to be on my own
Yeah and I keep breaking down
Breaking down, you know?

So hold on one more night
Hold out one more day
Hold on one more night
Hold out one more day

There'll be one more night and things will be made right
Again I'll hold you tight my dear
One more day and I'll collect my pay
And soon be far away from here
