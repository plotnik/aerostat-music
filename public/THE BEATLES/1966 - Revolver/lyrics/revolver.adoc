== Taxman

[verse]
____
Let me tell you how it will be, 
There's one for you, nineteen for me, 
Cause I'm the Taxman, 
Yeah, I'm the Taxman. 
Should five per cent appear too small, 
Be thankful I don't take it all, 
Cause I'm the Taxman, 
Yeah, I'm the Taxman. 
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street, 
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat, 
If you get too cold, I'll tax the heat, 
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet. 
Taxman. 
Cause I'm the Taxman, 
Yeah, I'm the Taxman. 
Don't ask me what I want it for 
(Taxman Mister Wilson) 
If you don't want to pay some more 
(Taxman Mister Heath), 
Cause I'm the Taxman, 
Yeah, I'm the Taxman. 
Now my advice for those who die, 
Declare the pennies on your eyes, 
Cause  I'm the Taxman, 
Yeah, I'm the Taxman. 
And you're working for no-one but me, 
Taxman.

== Eleanor Rigby

[verse]
____
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,
Lives in a dream.
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door,
Who is it for?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear,
No one comes near.
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there,
What does he care?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church and was buried along with her name,
Nobody came.
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave,
No one was saved.

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

== I'm Only Sleeping

[verse]
____
When I wake up early in the morning, 
Lift my head, I'm still yawning. 
When I'm in the middle of a dream, 
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream), 
Please don't wake me, no, don't shake me, 
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping. 

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy. 
I don't mind, I think they're crazy 
Running everywhere at such a speed, 
Till they find there's no need (there's no need), 
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away, 
And after all, I'm only sleeping. 

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window, 
Taking my time, lying there and staring at the ceiling,
Waiting for a sleepy feeling. 
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away, 
And after all, I'm only sleeping. 

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window, 
Taking my time. 

When I wake up early in the morning, 
Lift my head, I'm still yawning. 
When I'm in the middle of a dream, 
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream), 
Please don't wake me, no, don't shake me, 
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping.

== Love You To

[verse]
____
Each day just goes so fast, 
I turn around, it's past, 
You don't get time to hang a sign on me. 
Love me while you can, 
Before I'm a dead old man. 
A life-time is so short, 
A new one can't be bought, 
But what you've got means such a lot to me. 
Make love all day long, 
Make love singing songs. 
Make love all day long, 
Make love singing songs. 
There's people standing round, 
Who'll screw you in the ground, 
They'll fill you in with their sins, 
You'll see. 
I'll make love to you, 
If you want me to.
____

== Here, There And Everywhere

[verse]
____
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here.

Here, making each day of the year,
Changing my life with a wave of her hand.
Nobody can deny that there's something there.

There, running my hands through her hair,
Both of us thinking how good it can be.
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there.

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care.
But to love her is to need her everywhere.

Knowing that love is to share;
Each one believing that love never dies,
Watching her and hoping I'm always there.

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care.
But to love her is to need her everywhere.

Knowing that love is to share;
Each one believing that love never dies,
Watching her and hoping I'm always there.

I will be there
And everywhere,
Here, there and everywhere.

== Yellow Submarine

[verse]
____
In the town where I was born,
Lived a man who sailed the sea.
And he told us of his life,
In the land of submarines.

So we sailed on to the sun,
Till we found the sea of green,
And we lived beneath the waves,
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine,
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine,

And our friends are all aboard,
Many more of them live next door,
And the band begins to play.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine,
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine,

As we live a life of ease,
Ev'ryone of us has all we need,
Sky of blue and sea of green,
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine,
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

== She Said She Said

[verse]
____
She said I know what it's like to be dead, 
I know what it is to be sad, 
And she's making me feel like I've never been born.
I said who put all those things in your head, 
Things that make feel that I'm mad, 
And you're making me feel like I've never been born. 
She said you don't understand what I said, 
I said no no no you're wrong, when I was a boy, 
Everything was right, everything was right. 
I said even though you know what you know, 
I know that I'm ready to leave, 
Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born. 
She said you don't understand what I said, 
I said no no no you're wrong, when I was a boy,

Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born. 
She said I know what it's like to be dead,

== Good Day Sunshine

[verse]
____
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.

I need to laugh, and when the sun is out,
I've got something I can laugh about.
I feel good in a special way.
I'm in love an' it's a sunny day.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.

We take a walk the sun is shining down,
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.

Then we'd lie beneath a shady tree.
I love her and she's loving me.
She feels good. She knows she's looking fine.
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.

== And Your Bird Can Sing

[verse]
____
Tell me that you've got ev'rything you want,
And your bird can sing,
But you don't get me,
You don't get me.

You say you've seen seven wonders,
And your bird is green,
But you can't see me,
You can't see me.

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down,
Look in my direction,
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round.

When your bird is broken,
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken,
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round.

You tell me that you've heard ev'ry sound there is,
And your bird can swing,
But you can't hear me.
You can't hear me.
____

== For No One

[verse]
____
Your day breaks,
Your mind aches,
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you.

She wakes up,
She makes up,
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry;
She no longer needs you.

And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
A love that should have lasted years.

You want her
You need her,
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead;
You think she needs you.

And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
A love that should have lasted years.

You stay home,
She goes out,
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone;
She doesn't need him.

Your day breaks,
Your mind aches,
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head;
You won't forget her.

And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
A love that should have lasted years.
____

== Doctor Robert

[verse]
____
Ring my friend I said you'd call Doctor Robert, 
Day or night he'll be there anytime at all, 
Doctor Robert, 

Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man, 
He helps you to understand, 
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert. 

If you are down he'll pick you up, Doctor Robert, 
Take a drink from his special cup, Doctor Robert, 

Doctor Robert, he's a man you must believe, 
Helping every one in need, 
No one can succeed like Doctor Robert. 

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine, 
Well, well, well, he'll make you, Doctor Robert. 

My friend works with the National Health, 
Doctor Robert, 
Don't pay money just to see yourself with 
Doctor Robert, 

Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man, 
He helps you to understand, 
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert. 

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine, 
Well, well, well, he'll make you Doctor Robert. 
Ring my friend I said you'd call 
Doctor Robert.
____

== I Want To Tell You

[verse]
____
I want to tell you, 
My head is filled with things to say, 
When you're here, 
All those words they seem to slip away. 
When I get near you, 
The games begin to drag me down, 
It's alright, 
I'll make you maybe next time around. 
But if I seem to act unkind, 
It's only me, it's not my mind, 
That is confusing things. 
I want to tell you, 
I feel hung up and I don't know why, 
I don't mind, I could wait for ever, 
I've got time. 
Sometimes I wish I knew you well, 
Then I could speak my mind and tell you 
Maybe you'd understand. 
I want to tell you, 
I feel hung up and I don't know why, 
I don't mind, I could wait for ever, 
I've got time. I've got time.

== Got To Get You Into My Life

[verse]
____
I was alone, I took a ride,
I didn't know what I would find there.
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there.

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Ev'ry single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie,
You knew I wanted just to hold you.
And had you gone, you knew in time we'd meet again,
For I had told you.

Ooh, you were meant to be near me,
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together ev'ry day.

Got to get you into my life!

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you, I want to stay there.
If I'm true I'll never leave,
And if I do, I know the way there.

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Ev'ry single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life!
____


== Tomorrow Never Knows

[verse]
____
Turn off your mind relax and float down-stream, 
It is not dying, it is not dying, 
Lay down all thought surrender to the void, 
It is shining, it is shining. 

That you may see the meaning of within, 
It is being, it is being, 
That love is all and love is everyone, 
It is knowing, it is knowing. 

That ignorance and haste may mourn the dead, 
It is believing, it is believing, 
But listen to the color of your dreams, 
It is not living, it is not living. 

Or play the game "existence" to the end. 
Of the beginning, of the beginning. 
Of the beginning. Of the beginning.
