He got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller

== Something

[verse]
____
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover,
Something in the way she woos me.
I don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover.
Something in her style that shows me.
I don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.
You're asking me will my love grow,
I don't know, I don't know.
You stick around now it may show,
I don't know, I don't know.
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her,
Something in the things she shows me.
I don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.

== Maxwell’s Silver Hammer

[verse]
____
Joan was quizzical,  studied metaphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine calls her on the phone,
Can I take you to the pictures, Joan.
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock come on the door.
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head,
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.
Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again, teacher gets annoyed,
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene,
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind,
Writing fifty times I must not be so
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind,
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head,
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.
P.C. thirty-one said, we've caught a dirty one,
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery say he must go free.  (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so, oh, oh, oh.
But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind,
Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head,
Bang, bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead.
Silver hammer.

I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade.

Resting our head on the sea bed in an octopus's garden near a cave.
We would sing and dance around because we know we can't be found.
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade.
We would shout and swim about the coral that lies beneath the waves.
Oh what joy for every girl and boy knowing they're happy and they're safe.
We would be so happy, you and me, no one there to tell us what to do,
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden with you.

Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go.
But oh that magic feeling nowhere to go.

Pick up the bags, get in the limousine.
Soon we'll be away from here.
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away,
One sweet dream came true today, came true today.

All good children go to heaven.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
All good children go to heaven.

Shaves in the dark

Saving up to buy some clothes.

Only place that he's ever been.
Always shouts out something obscene,
Such a dirty old man, dirty old man.

== She Came in Through the Bathroom Window

[verse]
____
Come on, now...Oh, look out
She came in through the bathroom window,
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me.

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rock.

Didn’t anybody tell her
Didn’t anybody see
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me...oh, yeah.

And I will sing a lullaby.
