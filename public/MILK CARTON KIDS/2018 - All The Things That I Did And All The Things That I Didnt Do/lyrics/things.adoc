== Just Look At Us Now

[verse]
____
When I was a kid you could look in my eyes and see the whole world spinning there
I used to walk out in the rain at night just to feel it soak into my hair
I could've sworn we were headed somewhere
It was a fantasy that only drew empty stares
Angry "I don't knows" and "I don't cares"

Just look at us now
Just look at us now

When I was a kid you could look to a time when all the wars had come and gone
It was the end of all history, and dust settled down, it was a new dawn
We wanted to prove we were something, we were special
We knew in our hearts we weren't the only ones
Somehow we turned around and we were wrong

Just look at us now
Just look at us now

I cried out with no reply
Into the silence of the night
To the child that I don't recognize

When I met you you could look in my eyes and see a love light burning there
We used to walk up in the hills at dawn to see the world coming up for air
You could've told me it would never end
Nothing could ever come between such two good friends
Make me another promise if you dare

Just look at us now
Just look at us now

== Nothing Is Real

[verse]
____
Nothing is real
You're fooling yourself
Nothing is real
I'm sick to my stomach
There's got to be somethin' else

Nothing is real
Your mother's a program
You're losing your mind
True love is binary
Beauty's a lie

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
How could I?

Nothing is real
Open your heart
All that you feel
Is coded imprisoned
In pixels and algorithms

Nothing is real
The wind isn't blowing
The sun doesn't shine
Songs are just subroutines
Value's assigned

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
How could I?
How could I?
How could I mind? 
____

== Younger Years

[verse]
____
Above the plains of Omaha
I think of all the suffering I saw
The soaking of the pavement
Sprawled upon a land without a law
Everything I loved, everything I found or I hoped for
Frightened, I'm surrounded
Who else is there to turn to anymore?

Oh I held out my arms
Oh I held out my arms
Held out my arms

There was a time I spoke the truth
But my younger years were wasted on my youth
Somewhere I awakened
With a crack to a pounding on the roof
Sure I heard the sound
As evidence, or better yet as proof
I was as naked as the day that I was born
Beneath the fullness of the moon

Oh I held out my arms
Oh I held out my arms
Held out my arms

Far away I hear singing
Far away, a song

The blinding light of morning came
Flooding through the window like a friend
Like a wild revelation
Like a shining invitation to attend
Spoken as a prayer
Unbroken by despair I make amends
The love inside our hearts
Is the only kind of savior we've been sent

Oh I held out my arms
Oh I held out my arms
Held out my arms 
____

== Mourning In America

[verse]
____
Fell asleep with the TV on
Finally feelin' like I belong
Woke up to a funeral song
Called you up to say "hello"
Left a message for you at home
Packed my dishes in styrofoam
Everything I knew is gone

It's raining in Ohio
The streets are slick, shows what I know
I hear their cries through my window
They're mourning again in America
Mourning again in America

Tied my shoes when I woke up
Drew my curtains just enough
Thought about the ones I love
Tucked my chin into my coat
Shrugged my shoulders, cleared my throat
Walked the banks of the Ohio
Felt a chill to the bone

It's raining in Ohio
The streets are slick, shows what I know
I hear their cries through my window
They're mourning again in America
Mourning again in America
Mourning again in America
Mourning again in America 
____

== You Break My Heart

[verse]
____
You break my heart into so many pieces
You break my heart like nobody does
You break my heart in all the right places
Then again, you break it some more

You break my heart as if you meant to
Now I know there's no way you'd know
How you'd break my heart, then take my heart
Then break my heart for good

You break my heart as if you meant to
Now I know there's no way you'd know
How you'd break my heart, then take my heart
Then break my heart for good 
____

== Blindness

[verse]
____
Last night in a dream I had traveled back in time
Our feet were in the water and you put your hand in mine
I was blinded by the sunrise but I could not look away
You were in there somewhere, I could not get you to stay

This is where I live
In the spaces in between
The harsh light of the morning
And the magic of the dream
In one of them I'm dying
In one I never do
In one of them you're breathing
So I know you're there, too

Finally, I woke up in the darkness of the night
The shadow of the rain falling in the lone streetlight
I thought I heard a whisper reaching from the past
An echo, a reminder that nothing ever lasts

This is where I live
In the spaces in between
The harsh light of the morning
And the magic of the dream
In one of them I'm dying
In one I never do
In one of them you're breathing
So I know you're there, too 
____

== One More For The Road

[verse]
____
Oh, just one more for the road
Oh, just one more for the road
This world can be so cold
Before I let you go
Just one more for the road

Oh, I've seen it coming slow
Oh, I've seen it coming slow
The whistle blowing low
Our wishes push and pull
Just one more for the road

Oh, the moon is barely full
Oh, the moon is barely full
Be still my heart and soul
Our long lost rock and roll
Just one more for the road

Oh, just one more for the road
Oh, just one more for the road
This world can be so cold
Before I let you go
Just one more for the road 
____

== Big Time

[verse]
____
I've lowered my glass to the table
I've fashioned this smile from a dream
The stars overhead bear their meaning
With the weight of the sky, or so it seems
Speak to the voices imagined
In stories you sing from afar
The tiniest voices resound from
From the murmur, the trace, and the scars

Sometimes the thread comes bear
Sometimes I look for me to find you there

This'll be the last time
I'm gonna walk the straight line
This'll be the last time
I'm gonna be my last crime
This'll be the last time
This'll be the last time
But we're gonna have a big time
Yeah we're gonna have a big time

Cast out this bad land with witness
Like smoke from a railroad in plume
Stone crumbled soft 'neath the bedside
In colors the earth left to ruin
Speak with a trace owed to tempests
Of grace so unkind, I don't dare
Your mind shows the power, the proof, that
That judgement's a spectre, a prayer

Sometimes the thread comes bear
Sometimes I look for me to find you there

This'll be the last time
I'm gonna walk the straight line
This'll be the last time
I'm gonna be my last crime
This'll be the last time
This'll be the last time
But we're gonna have a big time
Yeah we're gonna have a big time

The weight of your mind holds to capture
Closing your eyes holds the key
Imagine a world that's living
Imagine an air you can breathe
So I raise up my glass to the sky now
I've lowered the lights to a purr
I weep at the sight of your virtue
To ward off the demons for sure

Sometimes the thread comes bear
Sometimes I look for me to find you there

This'll be the last time
I'm gonna walk the straight line
This'll be the last time
I'm gonna be my last crime
This'll be the last time
This'll be the last time
But we're gonna have a big time
Big time
Oh now, we're gonna have a big time
We're gonna have a big time 
____

== A Sea Of Roses

[verse]
____
I lose sleep at night like a young man who's in the fight of his young life
I have never known the way the wind would blow if everything were fine
I'm scared that when I die I'll be alone with no one sitting by my side
No, I do not think that I could be alone when I die

Lay me down in the ground
Put me back into the earth
Among all of my friends
Under a blanket of roses
A sea of flowers overhead

A field outside of Nashville pitches color to the dreariness of day
So the air hangs soft and tender, blowing around my thoughts whichever way
Where hills, they rise for miles and miles, I recognize the cryin' in the wind
I hear people come from everywhere to say goodbye sweet-like to their kin

Lay me down in the ground, put me back into the earth
Among all of my friends under a blanket of roses
A sea of flowers overhead

That is right, I don't believe any more than sky's above
It's just me and those I've loved under a blanket of roses
A sea of flowers overhead
When I die 
____

== Unwinnable War

[verse]
____
I belong to places in between
I've been wrong many times before
Chosen sides in an unwinnable war
So badly I needed something to fight for

I've been open, I've been gone
I've been hoping for so long
Go on and take all you can from me
Hoping no one notices when I take my leave

I am blind in the unforgiving face
Of what I find and what has been erased
Paralyzed and held at bay
So badly I needed something I could change 
____

== I've Been Loving You

[verse]
____
I've been loving you the way I wanted to
The way I thought that you wanted my love
I've been loving you, been loving you
All along

But the light has come to me, I see
I've been loving you, been loving you
All wrong

Try to believe I love you
In the night how I cry, I cry of you
I've been loving you, been loving you
All wrong

I cry
I cry
I cry
I cry 
____

== All The Things...

[verse]
____
I have the weight of the world on my chest.
Well, sometimes it feels that way.
For real, when my mind's at its best
I still feel afraid.

Light turns to dark and my tears turn to ice
As I turn to my lover and thinking I'm right
I tell only the truth, every last little thing that I knew.
All the things that I did and all the things that I didn't do...

From the start I moved heaven and earth
Just to take you to dinner and, boy, was that worth all the years
That would follow us around and around and around.

In all of that spinning I know now
How I didn't know what I needed to know.
I bury my feelings down deep where my heart never goes.
All the things that I did and all the things that I didn't know...

So what began as a fairy tale, we know, became very real:
Scary and, at times, too much.
But we'd held it together then we'd double down on our luck.

For all of the times I counted the lines
In your hair as you slept by my side,
I'm sure that you cried, and you cried, and you cried. So did I.
All the things that I did and all the things that I didn't try…

Off in the distance I see you once more.
We laugh at the stories we cried to before.
I'll tell you where I've been. You'll tell me how you've been.
We'll laugh, we'll laugh again. The story will go…

The story of how the end came to be.
How you became you. How I became me.
How we became lovers. How we became friends.
Sisters and brothers. Beginning to end…

It's four in the morning, I'm telling this story about
What you taught me of love.
They hear what I'm saying but no way they know what I know.

I know I'll take you with me
Everywhere I take my body and soul.
I'll take others too but not one any more than you.
All the things that I did and all the things that I didn't do...

All the things that I did and all the things that I didn't do...
